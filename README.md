# thinkubator-rag

This project develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with a user-friendly frontend for thinkubator.earth. Thinkubator.earth is dedicated to advancing the circular economy through education, research, and consulting, actively promoting environmental and social responsibility.

This RAG pipeline will empower users to:
1. Query the RAG pipeline for information.
2. Upload new files to expand the knowledge base.
3. Log in to the hosted website for secure access.
