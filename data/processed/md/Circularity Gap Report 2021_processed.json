As an impact \norganisation, we identify opportunities \nto turn circular economy principles into \npractical reality. \nWith nature as our mentor, we combine \npractical insights with scalable responses \nto humanity’s greatest challenges. \nOur vision is economic, social and \nenvironmental prosperity, without \ncompromising the future of our planet. \nOur mission is to connect and empower a \nglobal community in business, cities and \ngovernments to create the conditions for \nsystemic transformation.\nThe Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE): This report is \npublished as part of the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). \nPACE is a public-private collaboration mechanism and project accelerator \ndedicated to bringing about the circular economy at speed and scale. It brings \ntogether a coalition of more than 70 leaders and is co chaired by the heads of \nRoyal Philips and the Global Environment Facility. It was initiated at the  \nWorld Economic Forum and is currently hosted by the World Resources Institute.\nBEHIND THE COVER\nThe image shows the ripple effects of even the smallest of actions: while a single \npiece of gum clinging to a wall is trivial, the accumulation of billions has a massive \nimpact. The same can be said for our individual ecological footprints, which have \nmerged to spark a climate emergency. This image reminds us that the power to \nenact change is within all of us and that we are even more powerful if we come \ntogether. Collaborative circular climate action is within our reach.\n\nIN SUPPORT OF THE\nCIRCULARITY GAP REPORT\nPAVAN SUKHDEV\nPresident of WWF International\n‘The Circularity Gap Report 2021 shines a light on the elephant \nin the room: that we can only achieve the goals of the Paris \nAgreement by managing and consuming materials in a \nmore circular way. This report gives all nations practical and \ninnovative policy guidance and strategies that can be included \nin their updated Nationally Determined Contributions.’\nANDRE HOFFMANN\nEnvironmentalist, \nPhilanthropist & Vice-Chairman \nof Roche\n‘Climate change is undeniably the biggest market failure of the \n20th century.

The Circularity \nGap Report 2021 plays a key role here by providing highly \nvaluable analysis, data, guidance and examples that build  \nthe necessary momentum for circularity in this critical  \ndecade ahead.’\n’The  Circularity Gap Reports show the circular economy’s \nenormous emission mitigation potential and key role in \nachieving our climate goals, as well as the need for national \nand global action. We need systemic change in how we use \nour resources, that goes beyond recycling and incorporates \nnew business models, design and metrics. In order to fully \nunderstand our progress and identify specific action areas,  \nwe need a variety of coordinated metrics, including the \nCircularity Gap Report .’\nDIMITRI DEVREEZE\nCo-CEO of Royal DSM\n‘More than half of all greenhouse gas emissions are caused \nby the use of our planet’s resources, such as minerals, metals \nand biomass. If the world economy is to be successfully \nsustainable and resilient, then circularity must be built in \nfrom the start as we endeavor to design out waste and \npollution.

But to make it real, as the Report  shows, \nwill require many efforts and a system change, also in our \nunderstanding of the circular economy and its relation to \nclimate change.

I have \ncome to the conclusion that this will occur when we have \ntransitioned to a carbon neutral circular economy.  \nZero-carbon energy is a crucial part of the transformation, \nbut it is not enough. The Circularity Gap Report 2021 quantifies \nthe essential role that a more circular economy will have \nin meeting global societal needs, without exceeding our \navailable carbon budget. In a time of post-covid-19 economic \nreconstruction, it highlights the way forward in building \nsustainable society.’\n‘To fight climate breakdown our system needs a major \noverhaul. A truly circular economy mimics nature and can \nensure the restoration of our environment and reconnect \nhumans with the natural world.

For the upcoming COP26, the circular \neconomy needs to be at the heart of the conference.’\nABOUT THE CIRCULARITY GAP REPORT\nThe first Circularity Gap Report presented the \nalarming statistic that our world economy was only \n9.1% circular, leaving a massive Circularity Gap. The \nReport, launched in January 2018 during the World \nEconomic Forum in Davos, has since been updated \nand published on an annual basis. This iteration \nmarks the fourth edition. The Reports provide \nhigh-level insights into the global metabolism and \nkey levers for transitioning to circularity, as well \nas supporting decision-makers by communicating \nmetrics and better measurement of the circular \neconomy to guide their action. Yet, updating the \nCircularity Metric is not feasible on an annual basis \ndue to the limited availability of data. Since 2020, \nthe Circularity Gap Reporting Initiative also explores \nhow data to inform stakeholder decision-making \ncan best be collected, communicated and made \nglobally accessible. For updates and contact details \nwe encourage you to visit our website:  \ncircularity-gap.world\n7\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n6\n\n\nEnacted globally, a circular economy can close the \nEmissions Gap.  This study shows that combining \nthe twin agendas of circular economy and climate \nmitigation gets us on a path to a well below 2-degree \nworld by 2032. In adopting a roadmap packed with \ncircular strategies, we can pave the way for the \nsystemic transformations needed to course-correct \nthe global economy—going far beyond the limitations \nof current policy and national climate pledges. The \ncurrent pledges bring us over 15% of the way; the \ncircular economy delivers the other 85%. If the coming \ndecade is the decisive one for humanity’s future on \nearth, then 2021 is the year to ramp up our efforts \nto bring our goals into realistic reach and prevent \nthe worst effects of climate breakdown. Our current \neconomy is only 8.6% circular, leaving a massive \nCircularity Gap. The good news is that we only need to \nclose the Gap by a further 8.4%—or roughly double the \ncurrent global figure of 8.6%—to get there.\nHowever, circularity in our 8.6% world is trending \ndown, not up. Whilst the Circularity Gap Report 2020  \nrevealed that the global economy was only 8.6% \ncircular, just two years earlier it was 9.1%—things have \ngot worse. So, although we only need to almost double \ncircularity to close the Emissions Gap by 2032, the \nglobe remains shackled by outdated ‘take-make-waste’ \npractices. Humanity has now also breached two major \nmilestones: the world is consuming 100 billion tonnes \n(Gt) of materials and it is 1-degree warmer. Due to data \nunavailability, the Circularity Metric was not updated \nfor this year, yet all indicators point to the reality that \nthe globe remains engulfed by the linear economy and \nits unsustainable practices, processes and behaviours. \nHowever, when the covid-19 pandemic swept the \nworld in 2020, we saw empty skies and roads, as entire \npopulations were placed under national lockdown. \nTemporary as the resulting  drop in annual global \nemissions may be, it has shown us what is possible: \nfrom governments to citizens, we are now armed with \nthe knowledge that transformational change is doable. \nAnd time is running out. Even if all countries that \npledged climate action as part of the Paris Agreement \nfulfil their emissions-cutting promises, the rise in \ntemperatures is still forecast to hit 3.2-degrees this \nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\ncentury.1 Global warming shows no signs of slowing \nand the reality is that certain vulnerable cities and \ncountries will face catastrophes that threaten much \nof the population. 2 And in a cruel irony, lower-\nincome nations who contribute the fewest emissions \nare also most vulnerable to the impacts of climate \nbreakdown. We are already past the point of minor \namends. Course-correction will require a major, \ntransformational gear-change in systemic thinking. \nThis big shift is the circular economy.\nClimate breakdown demands more than current \nclimate pledges can deliver.  This Circularity Gap \nReport  quantitatively maps how greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions and resources move through our \neconomy, from extraction to end-of-use. What we \nfind is that material handling and use 3 accounts for \nthe vast majority (70%) of GHGs 4 emitted. This proves \nhow vital it is to look beyond the narrow energy focus \nof the current climate pledges to make a real impact. \nBy applying circular strategies at the intersection of \nmaterials and emissions hotspots, we can increase \nvalue-retention and cut excessive consumption, \nthereby slashing GHGs. This is how narrowing the \nCircularity Gap, in turn, closes the Emissions Gap.\nA circular economy can satisfy societal needs and \nwants by doing more with less. We need materials to \nfuel our lifestyles; this produces emissions. However, \nthe circular economy ensures that with less material \ninput and fewer emissions, we can still deliver the \nsame, or better, output. Through smart strategies \nand reduced material consumption, we find that the \ncircular economy has the power to shrink global GHG \nemissions by 39%  and cut virgin resource use by 28% . \nWithin this, the societal need of Housing delivers half \nof the impact, while Mobility and Nutrition account for \nmuch of the rest. To get to our end goal of a socially \njust and ecologically safe space 5, we need intelligent \nresource management to stem consumption and \ncut emissions, so their impact falls within planetary \nboundaries. \nCountries: another year lost in the race to get it \nright.  No country is firmly on the path to achieving \nour goal of a socially just and ecologically safe space. 6 \nThey do, though, wield power—especially now. \nEconomic stimulus packages to pull countries out of \ntheir post-pandemic slumps are rolling out and the \ncrunch UN summit, the COP26, has been postponed \nto Autumn 2021. This means we have lost valuable \ntime to accelerate action, especially as the majority \nof countries were not on track to update their already \n‘woefully inadequate’ 7 climate pledges by the end of \n2020.8 To guide this process, we examine the common \nchallenges and opportunities for three overarching \ncountry profiles and present blueprints for action \ntailored to each context and set of unique climate \npledges. For countries, this truly is their time.\nThis is the real year of truth. With 2020 struck \nby covid-19, lockdowns around the globe not only \ncontributed to a sharp decline in emissions, but \nalso accelerated decommissioning of fossil assets. 9 \nDespite this progress being unintended and arguably \ntemporary, it can teach us valuable lessons to translate \ninto structural change—and now, the world seems \nto be listening. Emboldened by universal uptake of \nrenewables, governments are making decisions that \nwill positively shape our climate future. The events \nof 2020 also served to hold a magnifying glass to the \nflaws in our system—an unsustainably linear system \nreliant on the exploitation of nature and people—\nand there is no environmental justice, without social \njustice. Destructive and instructive as the pandemic \nproved, it is ultimately climate breakdown that will be \nthe biggest global health-threat of the century. 10 In a \ntime of building back better, the circular economy has \nnever been more relevant.\n9\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n8\n\n\n1\nINTRODUCTION\n12  - 17\n2\nMIND THE GAPS  \nEmissions and material hotspots  \nin the linear economy  \n18  - 23\n3\nMETRICS BEHIND  \nTHE GAPS\nGlobal circularity \nthe Emissions Gap\n24  - 27\n4\nBRIDGING THE GAPS\nOur roadmap to a well below  \n2-degree world\n28 - 35\n5\nSETTING A NEW COURSE\nThe transformational impact  \nof circularity\n36  - 43\n6\nTAILORED TRANSITION \nPATHWAYS\nCountry profile roadmaps\n44  - 57\n7\nNATIONAL CLIMATE \nPLEDGES & THE NDCS\nEnabling a global circular economy\n58  - 63\n8\nTHE WAY FORWARD\n64  - 65\n \nCONTENTS\nBRIDGE THE GAPS THROUGH \nLEADERSHIP AND ACTION\n \n1. Build a coalition for action that is both diverse and \ninclusive. Bringing a diverse community of businesses, \ngovernments, NGOs and academics together to boost \ncapacity and capability will accelerate collective action \ntoward circularity, serving the betterment of societal needs \nand global ecological health. This will enable action toward \nreaching the Paris Agreement’s goals before it’s too late and \nbegin to build the necessary infrastructure and alliances to \ncollect, retrieve and share circular knowledge on a global \nlevel.\n2. Integrate plans for leveraging the circular economy \ninto national climate pledges.  Circular strategies suited \nto different country profiles can get nations back on a well \nbelow 2-degree pathway. Integrating tailored plans can also \nenable better goal-setting, measurement and benchmarking \nfor countries in the NDC revision process, and ensure that \neach nation can address global issues in a way that aligns to \ntheir local context, incentives and mandates. This can also \nsupport key industries that need to shoulder the change.\n3. Create an enabling environment to facilitate the \ncircular transition. Market and regulatory failures that \ninhibit the enabling conditions needed for circular initiatives \nto reach scale can be addressed by policymakers; including \nsteering away from financial models that only support linear \nprojects. Capital must also be mobilised toward circular \ninitiatives to unlock the potential of ‘building back better’.\nPhoto by Ivan Bandura\n11\nThe Circularity Gap Report  202110\n\n\nHumanity is living beyond the means of Planet \nEarth. Our use of finite resources continues to spiral \nupward; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue \nto disperse into the air. The earth continues to heat \nup. It is becoming clear that we’re running out of \ntime to course-correct. Yet, in light of rapid global \nchange, since the covid-19 pandemic struck in March \n2020, the world is finally waking up. Covid-19 has \ndisrupted business-as-usual. Climate breakdown, \nresource scarcity and ecological collapse have \nmoved from the horizon to the now, as shocks and \ncrises have exposed the fragility of our current, \nlinear system. Calls to ‘build back better’ with a \ngreen recovery—thereby mending the impacts of \nthe pandemic in a way that also addresses climate \nbreakdown—are strong. This 2021 edition of the \nCircularity Gap Report quantifies the huge synergistic \nand transformational power the circular economy \nholds for the climate mitigation agenda—just in \ntime for this year’s crunch UN summit that will  \npave our future climate pathways. In getting \nsmarter about our global resource use and \nconsumption, we can close the globe’s widening \nCircularity and Emissions Gaps. Closing both Gaps \ntogether will put us firmly back on a path toward \nthe goal of the Paris Agreement: limiting warming  \nto well below 2-degrees. \n1 BILLION TONNES, 1-DEGREE GLOBAL \nWARMING\nIn our 2020 Circularity Gap Report , we recorded a \nbleak, first-time milestone: 100 billion tonnes of \nmaterials enter the global economy every year. These \nmaterials are funnelled through our economy and \nallow us to continue our way of life. However, of \nthis massive amount, only 8.6% is cycled back into \nthe economy. For the past 200 years at least, the \nhallmark of global consumption and resource use \ncan be aptly described as ‘take-make-waste’: a linear \neconomy. Whilst this model has enabled vast growth, \na defining characteristic has unfortunately been huge \noverconsumption to the detriment of planetary health. \nFurthermore, despite bringing prosperity to some of \nthe population, some of the time, global social equity \nhas also been negatively impacted. In many parts of the \nworld, linear over-consumption has effectively become \nthe norm, whilst elsewhere, minimum living standards \nare not even being reached.\nIn 2017, we passed another bleak milestone: the \nthreshold of human activities causing 1-degree global \nwarming.11 In 2020, we reached 1.1-degrees. 12 To date, \nthe last five years have broken successive weather \nrecords and—even if the current climate pledges, \nthe Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), \nare followed—the global rise in temperatures is still \nforecast to hit 3.2-degrees this century. 13 This is an \nalarming number; the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) has warned that going beyond \n1.5-degrees alone will increase the frequency and \nintensity of climate impacts. In a 3-degree warming \nsituation, the globe risks being drowned by climate \nextremes such as floods, droughts and wildfires, \nall of which displace populations and increase food \ninsecurity. Global GHG emissions reached record highs \nin 2018, and despite dips following lockdown-lifestyles \ndue to covid-19, we are still far off track. This difference \nbetween ‘where we are likely to be and where we need \nto be’ has become known as the Emissions Gap.\nFIVE YEARS SINCE THE PARIS AGREEMENT\nThere has been, however, globally coordinated action \non climate breakdown. According to United Nations \nClimate Change, in 2015; 196 countries signed the \nParis Agreement. Worldwide climate action was set \nout: mitigation of climate change by limiting the \naverage global temperature rise this century to well \nbelow 2-degrees; support for lower-income nations \nand transparent reporting of climate goals. Things \ncould only get better—or so was the presumption. \nIt is now clear, though, that the blueprints mapped \nout for the globe in the form of national climate \npromises—NDCs—were never powerful enough \nto fulfil the Agreement’s well below 2-degree goal. \nWith a prevailing focus on renewable energy and an \nincremental focus on industries, they will not get us \nwhere we need to be. And in the five years that have \npassed since Paris, large gaps between promises and \nimplementation have emerged. With every year of \nslow progress, the challenge grows. More extreme \naction is necessary. However, what should have been \na pivotal moment for updating and strengthening the \nNDCs was missed: the COP26 in 2020 was cancelled \nand postponed to November 2021 due to the covid-19 \npandemic. As a result, 2021 has become a pivotal year \nfor climate action—the decisions we make this year will \nshape our future climate.\n1. INTRODUCTION\n13\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n12\n\n\n2.1-degree pathway—according to recent estimates—if \nbacked up with long-term action.We see momentum \nbuilding. There are also many facilitating factors that \nmake now a perfect time for action. 20 Renewable energy \nprices are dropping and if China and the EU continue  \nto invest in wind, solar and batteries, they will fall \nfurther, while climate legislation may see the price of  \ncarbon-intensive materials rise. \nTHE POWER OF COUNTRIES\nIn making these future-shaping decisions, countries \nclearly have potential—and potential is power. From \ndetermining the focus of each country’s NDC to \nfunnelling capital toward future-oriented innovation, \ntheir role is massive. The NDCs now largely focus on \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as \ncurbing emissions from land use, land-use change and \nforestry. Looking ahead, circular economy strategies \ncould be employed to support countries in identifying \nand developing mitigation options which go beyond \ncurrent pledges, both in scope and ambition.  \nBut different countries should take different paths. \nDifferent country profiles, although operating under \nsimilar overarching global trends, need to problem-\nsolve very differently and the implementation of circular \nstrategies will, therefore, differ between localities. \nHigher-income nations, that are responsible for the \noverwhelming majority of historical emissions, need \nto shift away from current linear paradigms that fuel \noverconsumption of the earth’s resources—and fast. \nEconomies that are still growing, or rapidly building,  \ncan navigate away from linearity now so that they don’t \nface the same challenges in the future. With this in mind, \nthis Circularity Gap Report tailors its global roadmap \nfor different country profiles in Chapter Six to deliver \nactionable roadmaps. In Chapter Seven, we dive into  \nthe on-the-ground barriers to the circular transition,  \nand recommend points of change for countries’ NDCs.  \nWith the pandemic, we have lost a valuable year \nto accelerate action. But the urgency is now more \napparent and the collective attitude more accepting of \nfundamental change. This report can guide countries \nin this process of making the course-correction we so \ndesperately need. For countries, this truly is their time.\nSAME GLOBAL NEEDS, RADICALLY FEWER \nMATERIALS AND EMISSIONS\nWhat this report will ultimately do is show the power \nof the circular economy to fulfil our global needs and \nwants, but with radically fewer materials and emissions. \nThe circular economy ensures that with less input, \nwe can deliver improved prosperity. This will require \nmore than just a focus on renewable energy: it calls \nfor transformational course-correction that not only \nencourages behavioural changes, but prompts a total \noverhaul of linear activities. In this report, we are also \ncareful to examine ethical considerations and  \ntrade-offs that could potentially arise in the transition  \nto circularity. The circular economy must not perpetuate \nthe same mistakes of the linear economy, which relies \non the continued exploitation of both people and planet. \nWe therefore pinpoint the seven core societal needs \nand wants that guide our research: Housing, Nutrition, \nMobility, Communications, Services, Consumables and \nHealthcare. Central to our proposition is ensuring that \nour roadmap for a well below 2-degree world is built \nupon scenarios that are resource efficient, but also \npeople-centric; the impact of one circular strategy could \nhave vastly different repercussions on communities in \ndifferent localities and this must be taken into account. \nThere is no environmental justice without social justice.  \nThe Circularity Gap Report approach shows the potential \nbenefits of circular economy solutions to trigger \ngovernment and company action with ‘what if’ scenarios. \nConsider this when interpreting the figures we use in \nour roadmap (detailed in Chapter Four), such as ‘cutting \nvirgin resource use by 28%’. This is important because \nours is not a dynamic modelling analysis (as used in \nthe Emissions Gap Reports): material extraction and \nemissions are not forecasted to 2030 or 2050, nor do our \ninterventions and scenarios account for technological or \nsocio-economic trends occurring in that period.\nAIMS OF THE CIRCULARITY\nGAP REPORT 2021\n1. Illustrate and quantify the mutually reinforcing \nrelationship of the circular economy and the climate \nmitigation agenda.\n2. Demonstrate the power of circular economy \nstrategies to close the Circularity Gap and the \nEmissions Gap and help us reach the goals of the \nParis Agreement.\n3. Accordingly, identify key interventions for  \nimpact, based on the needs of society, that are  \nresource-smart and low-emission. \n4. Identify how our scenarios can be tailored to \nnational levels to inform goal-setting and NDC \nrevision.\n5. Identify key pathways for three distinct country \nprofiles to transition towards the safe and just space.\nTHE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AS A MEANS  \nTO AN END\nSociety now finds itself at a historic economic and \ncultural crossroads. Do we continue to tweak and \ntamper with our broken linear model, cognisant of the \nconsequences and liable by default? Or, do we pivot \nto a new model—such as the circular economy—with \nfresh minds and new tools to pursue a desirable and \ndeliverable paradigm shift?\nThe circular economy holds the promise for systemic \ntransformation of our society, as its core tenants design \nout waste and pollution, keep products and materials \nin use and regenerate natural systems. 14 However, the \ncircular economy is also an action agenda with impact \nthat extends beyond resource efficiency. As a multi-\nstakeholder model, its systems-thinking approach \nboosts capacity and capability to serve universal \nsocietal needs. This circular framework aligns with \na vision of a more resource-aligned, people-centric \nfuture. But getting there will not be easy. A full circular \ntransition calls for creative innovation in systems design \nand rigorous collaboration across and within value-\nchains, plus among multiple stakeholders. Change may \nbe difficult, but it is necessary. Closing the Circularity \nGap serves the higher objective of preventing further \nand accelerated environmental degradation and social \ninequality. In moving the globe toward an ecologically \nsafe and socially just operating space for humankind, \nthe circular economy is a critical pathway. 15 \nIn our analysis, we have found that the vast majority \n(70%) of emissions 16 are associated with material \nhandling and use, demonstrating the clear and \nnecessary role for circular economy strategies—which \nlook to do more with less—in emissions reduction. The \naim of this report is to provide a quantified link between \nthe circular economy and climate mitigation agenda. \nWe create an x-ray of global emissions to unpack the \nblinking lights of climate breakdown and locate where \nemissions-material hotspots are to be found in our \neconomy. Building on this analysis, we set out both \nglobal and regional treatment plans to get us back on a \nwell below 2-degree and circular path.\nTHE REAL YEAR OF TRUTH\n2020 was struck by covid-19. The pandemic served \nto unite the global population in one sentiment: \nvulnerability—the vulnerability of our economy, of our \nenvironment and, ultimately, our future on earth. 17 \nCalls for a green recovery in alignment with other global \nchallenges have never been louder, and many see a \nrare opportunity like no other to build a resilient and \nlow-carbon economic future. The circular economy, \nas a tangible way of achieving this vision, is now more \nrelevant than ever. \nGovernments around the world are now making huge \ndecisions that will shape our climate future. Firstly, \nas a result of the impacts of the pandemic, stimulus \npackages designed to pull us out of economic slumps \nmean governments are now making decisions on \nhow to spend capital that could build back better and \nhelp set new goals for resilience and preparedness. \nAlternatively, in thrall to business-as-usual, they might \ninstead leave us vulnerable, divided and susceptible. \nThese stimulus packages could, for example, drive a \nhuge uptake in renewable energy, which in turn would \nspur jobs. The 2020 Emissions Gap report , which calls for \na green recovery, notes that around one-quarter of G20 \nmembers have dedicated shares of their spending, up \nto 3% of GDP, to low-carbon measures. For most others, \nspending has mostly been high-carbon or neutral. 18  \nMoreover, high hopes were being pinned by many on  \nthe COP26 UN summit supposed to take place in 2020, \nbut rescheduled for Autumn 2021. Therefore, how \ncountries move forward with their NDCs following the \nevents of the past year—and how governments take \naction to implement their pledges—can and will shape \nthe future of our climate for years to come.\nA GLOBAL COALITION TOWARD \nDECARBONISATION?\nThe encouraging announcements from a number \nof countries calling for a green recovery in 2020 \nlargely placed net-zero at the heart of action. Capital \nfunds enforced significant divestments in the fossil \nindustry. 19  So, are we seeing a global coalition toward \ndecarbonisation? Sweden, the UK, France, Denmark, \nNew Zealand, Hungary, China (which alone is responsible \nfor 28% of global emissions), South Korea and Japan \nall have a net-zero target in place by law (albeit with \ndifferent goal years). The recent election success of the \nBiden administration means the US will also rejoin the \nParis Agreement and the new President promises to \ndelivery net-zero emissions by 2050. Also, the European \nGreen Deal has stated the ambition to be the first zero \nemissions continent by 2050 with a specific Circular \nEconomy Action Plan as part of the roadmap. These \nrecent emissions-reduction pledges, especially from \nthe US and China, could potentially bring the world on a \n15\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n14\n\n\nMOBILITY\nA considerable resource and emissions \nfootprint is taken up by our need for \nmobility. In particular, two resource types \nare used: the materials to build transport \ntechnologies and vehicles like cars, trains \nand aeroplanes; plus, predominantly, the \nfossil fuels burned to power them.\nNUTRITION\nAlso with a large footprint is the need \nfor nutrition, which includes agricultural \nproducts such as crops and livestock. \nFood products have short lifecycles in \nour economy, being consumed quickly \nafter production.\nCONSUMABLES\nConsumables are a diverse and complex \ngroup of products —such as refrigerators, \nclothing, cleaning agents and paints —\nthat generally have short to medium \nlifetimes. Textiles, including clothing, also \nconsume different kinds of resources \nsuch as cotton, synthetic materials like \npolyester, dye pigments, and chemicals.\nHEALTHCARE\nWith an expanding, ageing and, on average, \nmore prosperous population, healthcare \nservices are increasing globally. Buildings \naside, typical resource groups include use  \nof capital equipment such as x-ray \nmachines, pharmaceuticals, hospital \noutfittings (beds), disposables and \nhomecare equipment.\nCOMMUNICATION\nCommunication is becoming an ever-\nmore important aspect of today’s \nsociety, provided by a mix of equipment \nand technology ranging from personal \nmobile devices to data centres. Increased \nconnectivity is also an enabler of the \ncircular economy, where digitisation can \nmake physical products obsolete, or \nenable far better use of existing assets, \nincluding consumables, building stock or \ninfrastructure.\nSERVICES\nThe delivery of services to society ranges \nfrom education and public services to \ncommercial services like banking and \ninsurance. The material and emissions \nfootprint is modest in total and typically \ninvolves the use of professional  \nequipment, office furniture, computers  \nand other infrastructure.\nSEVEN SOCIETAL NEEDS & WANTS\nHOUSING\nThe need that represents the largest \nresource and emissions footprint is \nfor construction and maintenance of \nresidential houses, especially in lower-\nincome nations.\nPhoto by Yogendra Singh\n17\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n16\n\n\nX-rays of global emissions\nand materials\nTHE\nMIND\nGAP(S)\n2\nCircularity is in reverse: our 2020 report commu -\nnicated that the global economy is 8.6% circular, \nwhile our 2018 edition reported 9.1%. Alongside our \nwidening Circularity Gap, the world is heating up.  \nIn 2017, for the first time, humanity consumed \nmore than 100 billion tonnes of materials and  \nincreased the mean global temperature by more \nthan 1-degree above pre-industrial level. 21 We need \nto course-correct. Therefore, this year we—in a \nfirst for the Circularity Gap Report —have created \nan x-ray of how global greenhouse gas emissions \nflow along through different value-adding stages \nof the economy. By taking an approach to global \nresource use that considers both mass and carbon, \nwe can consume fewer materials, increase value-re -\ntention and increase cycling back into the economy, \nwhilst simultaneously slashing emissions. In the \nface of mounting urgency, the solutions we apply to \nour situation must also be multidimensional. \nX-RAY OF OUR GLOBAL ECONOMY\nIn the first edition of the Circularity Gap Report released \nin 2018, we asked ourselves: how circular is the global \neconomy today? Supplying an answer to that question, \nas well as insights into key global levers to move us \ntoward circularity, are crucial for us to plan our path \nforward. Three consecutive reports have contributed \nto developing these insights, as well as bolstering \nmetrics for circularity as a discipline. We now know \nhow circular the globe is and what we need to do to \nclose the Gap.\nIt soon became clear how the circular economy has to \ndo more than look at material flows alone. In our 2019 \nreport, we introduced the Mass-Value-Carbon (MVC) \nnexus, a concept that looks at how much greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions (Carbon) and value-created (Value) \nget distributed through meeting our key societal \nneeds and wants with materials (Mass). Building on \nour MVC nexus concept and profoundly deepening \nour exploration, this report will scrutinise how global \nGHG emissions arise from the extraction, processing \nand use of resources. Following our signature style of \nproviding one single visual that gives an overview of \nthe entire global economy’s material flows, we will now \npresent one for global GHG emissions: our x-ray of \nglobal GHG emissions.\nPhoto by Jeremy Bishop\n19\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n\nEnd-of-use\n1.2 Gt\nORES\n38.4 Gt\nFOSSIL FUELS\n16.0 Gt\nBIOMASS\n1.6 Gt\nMINERALS\nResources Take Process Produce Provide Societal\nNeeds\nHOUSING\n13.5 Gt\n3.5 Gt\nCOMMUNICATION\n17.1 Gt\nMOBILITY\n3.0 Gt\nHEALTHCARE\n6.4 Gt\nSERVICES\n5.6 Gt\nCONSUMABLES\n10.0 Gt\nNUTRITION\n1.9 Gt\nWASTE\nCO /two.dnom 42.6 Gt\nCH/four.dnom 11.2 Gt\nN /two.dnom O 3.5 Gt\nF-GASES 1.8 Gt\nMetal ores\nMetal ores\nWood\nAnimals\nCrops\nLand use & \nland use change\nLand use & \nland use change\nWaste\nLand use & \nland use change\nLand use & \nland use change\n Material use in buildings\nMaterial use in \nindustry and food\nWaste management\nMaterial use in buildings\nWood products\nOther materials\nFood products\nManufacturing\nFood products\nWaste management\nElectronics\nMachinery & equipment\nOther products\nOther products\nPublic & private \nservices\nOther products\nPublic & private \nservices\nFood products\nWaste management\nPetroleum\nNatural gas\nCoal\nSand & clay\nStone\nEnergy use in transport\nEnergy use in buildings\nEnergy use in industry \nand food\nCement\nIron, steel & \nnon-ferrous metals\nChemicals, plastics & \nrubber\nTransport fuel \nproduction\nConstruction materials \nproduction\nTransport fuels\nVehicles\nEnergy use in \nresidential\nEnergy use in \nresidential\nEnergy carriers in \nnon-residential\nConstruction materials\nMaterial use in \nresidential\nEnergy carriers in \nnon-residential\nMaterial use in \nnon-residential\nResidential \nbuildings\nNon-residential \nbuildings\nExtraction\nMineral mining\nOres mining\nForestry\nFarming\nBefore energy carriers    such as oil, gas, coal and \nfuelwood undergo transformation (Process) into \nreﬁned materials, and energy and heat, they represent \n70% of emissions while, at this stage, materials are \nonly responsible for 30%.\nAt the point of ﬁnal consumption \n(Provide) the emissions related to \nenergy    become 30% and \nmaterials 70%.\nAt the point of ﬁnal consumption \n(Provide) the emissions related to \nenergy    become 30% and \nmaterials 70%.\nPassenger transport\nFreight transport\nTotal \nemissions \nembodied in \neach resource \ngroup\n59.1 Gt\nTHE EMISSIONS  \nX-RAY BEHIND  \nGLOBAL SOCIETAL \nNEEDS\nFigure One X-ray of global greenhouse gas emissions behind \nmeeting key societal needs and wants in billion tonnes (Gt).\nTo satisfy all global needs and wants, we emitted 59.1 \nbillion tonnes of GHGs in 2019, including land use, land-\nuse change and forestry (LULUCF). 22 This is the amount \nthat is dispersed into our atmosphere every year and it is \nthe mammoth tonnage that we seek to strip back 23. But \nfirst, we need to know where these emissions stem from \nto reduce them. Our emissions x-ray, Figure One, shows \nus how the vast majority of GHG emissions (70%) are \nultimately generated through material handling and use \n(at the Provide  level)—whether for the clothes we wear, \nthe phones we own, or the meals we eat. In illustrating \nhow 59.1 billion tonnes of emissions flow along and across \nglobal value-chains, Figure One allows us to gain a deeper \nunderstanding of the upstream drivers of those emissions. \nIn doing so, the necessity for integrated policies that \naddress embodied emissions becomes clear. 24 25\nBeginning from the left-hand side, we see how four \ntypes of resources—fossil fuels, minerals, ores and \nbiomass—are extracted ( Take) and put to use in \nthe global economy. Fossil fuels are responsible \nfor by far the most global embodied emissions \n(65%), with petroleum fueling much of the globe’s \ntransportation, plus coal and natural gas providing \ninputs for electricity, heat and industrial processes. \nThe second-largest source of embodied emissions is \nthe production of biomass through agricultural and \nforestry processes, with significant emissions (26%) \nrelated to LULUCF. This delivers us food products, \ntimber and fuelwood, as well as fibres for the textiles \nindustry. The extraction, basic processing and use \nof both ores and minerals (together with waste \nhandling) have the smallest emissions contribution, in \nrelative terms (8%), with calcination of cement  \nkiln being the most emissions-intensive  \nnon-combustion process.\nIt is interesting to observe how the switch between \nthe emissions related to materials and energy occurs. \nNotice that before energy carriers such as oil, gas, \ncoal and fuelwood undergo transformation ( Process ) \ninto refined materials, and energy and heat, they \nrepresent the majority of the emissions (70%); while, \nat this stage, materials are only responsible for 30% 26 \n27 (broken down into 23% material processing and 7% \nwaste management and LULUCF). These materials for \nindustry and construction then enter manufacturing \nand industrial processes in the form of plastic, rubber, \niron, cement and wood products.  \nEnergy carriers such as oil, gas, coal and\nfuelwood travel through the economy\nKey points in the value-chain (from Process  to Provide ) \nwhere emissions embodied in energy carriers and  \nmaterials shift and eventually switch\n21\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n20\n\n\nAdded to these materials is process heat and \nelectricity, as well as energy carriers such as oil \nderivatives, gas and coal. \nThey are then transformed ( Produce) into products \nsuch as electronics, capital equipment, construction \nmaterials and food. At this point, the balance between \nemissions related to energy versus materials has \nshifted to be almost fifty-fifty. Materials together \nrepresent 51% of all emissions, while the energy \nused to heat and cool buildings, light our homes \nand workspaces, as well as the energy that is used \nfor personal and freight transport, represents the \nremaining 49%. However, ultimately—at the point of \nfinal consumption ( Provide)—both freight transport \nand the lighting, heating and cooling of non-residential \nbuildings also serve material purposes: the emissions \nrelated to energy become 30% and materials, 70%. \nNow, a huge proportion of the emissions that were at \nfirst associated with energy carriers have gradually \nbecome embodied into finished goods and services \nwhich, in turn, satisfy the seven societal needs. \nEMISSIONS-INTENSIVE HOUSING,  \nMOBILITY AND NUTRITION\nProviding Mobility , Housing  and Nutrition  to the \nworld accounts for almost 70% of global emissions. \nMobility  leads the way with an emissions footprint \nof 17.1 billion tonnes. This is primarily the result \nof fossil fuel combustion across passenger and \nfreight transport. The production of automobiles, \ntrucks, trains and aeroplanes is relatively limited in \nemissions contributions. Responsible for the second-\nlargest footprint is Housing , at 13.5 billion tonnes of \nemissions. Housing’s  hefty footprint comes down \nto the vast extraction, transport and construction \nactivities it entails, as well as the energy used to light, \nheat and cool dwellings. Third in line is the provision of \nfood for Nutrition  with 10 billion tonnes of emissions. \nLULUCF associated with the production of food, but \nalso fibres and clearing for expansion of urban centres, \nis responsible for about 4  billion tonnes of emissions \n(high uncertainty). \nThe remaining 30% of emissions flow into satisfying \nCommunications , Services , Consumables  and \nHealthcare . At 6.4 billion tonnes of emissions, \nServices  is the biggest of the smaller needs. The \nfootprint for service provision includes the buildings \nand energy required for educational institutions, \nmuseums and other public-service properties, as \nwell as the material needs for their functioning. \nCommunication  is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes \nof emissions. These largely fuel communication \ninfrastructure as well data storage and communication \ndevices. The broad group of Consumables  accounts \nfor 5.6 billion tonnes of emissions for the production \nof clothing, personal health products and consumer \nelectronics. With the smallest footprint of all the \nsocietal needs and wants, Healthcare’s  footprint \nof 3 billion tonnes is mostly related to hospital \nbuildings, healthcare equipment such as MRI scanners \nand the production of medical disposables and \npharmaceuticals. \nDEVISING A TREATMENT PLAN THROUGH  \nA MASS-CARBON LENS\nWe now want to complement the insights the \nemissions x-ray has given us with the reality of material \nuse in our global economy. Material transformation \noffers the prospect of adding value at each step \nof the supply chain—from simple raw materials, \nthrough to complex products. As part of the same \nprocess, however, emissions and waste are generated. \nTherefore, when considering our economic activity \nmore holistically, we need to adopt different lenses—\nhere Mass-Carbon—to scrutinise the combined inputs \nand outputs from these steps and understand fully \nhow these activities contribute to meeting our societal \nneeds. In combining the material and emissions \nfootprints in Figure Two, we can see the multiple \navenues that hold the most impact from a  \nMass-Carbon perspective. \nBy revealing how both materials and emissions flow \nthrough the economy, Figure Two shows us that for \nsome societal needs, the focus areas where we can \nclose the Emissions Gap overlap with the focus areas to \nclose the Circularity Gap. Yet for other societal needs, \nthere is no overlap, and we must adapt our approach \naccordingly. From a material (Mass) perspective, \nMinerals  represent by far the largest share (51%), \nwhile they only make a minor contribution from an \nGHG emissions (Carbon) perspective (2.8%). That said, \nthere are still ‘hot spots’ along the mineral value-chain \nthat are exceptionally emissions-intensive, which we \nshould aim to bypass by applying circular strategies \n(as in the case of cement clinker production). The \nopposite is true for fossil fuels : in terms of materials \nthey represent a modest share of 15%, yet they are \nresponsible for 65% of emissions. These resources are \nalmost entirely used for combustion purposes.  \nRESOURCES & EMISSIONS\nTHE GLOBAL ECONOMY\nSOCIETAL NEEDS\nHOUSING\nCOMMUNICATION\nCONSUMABLES\nHEALTHCARE\nMOBILITY\nSERVICES\nNUTRITION\nORES\nFOSSIL \nFUELS\nBIOMASS\nMINERALS\n38.8 Gt\n13.5 Gt\nWASTE\n5.6 Gt\n3.5 Gt\n10.0 Gt\n6.4 Gt\n6.9 Gt\n5.6 Gt\n21.3 Gt\n10 Gt\n1.9 Gt\n16 Gt\n24.6 Gt\n38.4 Gt\n15.1 Gt\n10.1 Gt\n1.2 Gt\n50.8 Gt\n1.6 Gt\n8.7 Gt\n17.1 Gt\n9.3 Gt\n3 Gt\nEMISSIONS CO 2eq\nTHE GLOBAL\nECONOMY\nThis ﬁgure shows the material throughput \n(Mass) and GHG emissions (Carbon) \nassociated with the four resources (minerals, \nores, fossil fuels and biomass) on the left and \non the right the Mass-Carbon proﬁles for the \nseven societal needs.\nIt assesses the global economy through two \nlenses that are critical to circularity: \nemissions (Carbon) and materials (Mass). \nApplying Mass-Carbon thinking, it will assess \nboth the carbon emissions footprint, as well \nas the mass factors, behind meeting key \nsocietal needs, such as Housing, Mobility and \nNutrition. This analysis can, therefore, help to \nshow which societal needs consume what \nresources and cause GHG emissions. \nFigure Two The global resource and emissions footprint behind \nmeeting key societal needs, side by side. Units in billion \ntonnes (Gt).\nThe energy-density properties of fossil carriers \nmake them very lucrative as a commodity, but it is \nimpossible to bypass any steps in the value-chain \ndue to the very nature of their use. This is why we see \nfossil fuels as having no place in the circular economy. \nBiomass is responsible for around 25% of materials \nand 27% of emissions, yet as a resource it represents \nan interesting case: biomass captures carbon from the \natmosphere during its growth, but again is often used \nas an energy carrier, thereby eventually producing \nemissions. In applying circular strategies, we would \npromote the increase of carbon storage in biomass \n(through, for example, the use of wooden construction \nmaterials), while bypassing the emissions-producing \nsteps in the value-chain.\nIn using circular strategies, we can reconfigure these \nsupply chains to ‘bypass’ the emissions hot-spots.  \nBy swapping out emission-intensive processes such as \nsmelting and remanufacturing for metals, for example, \nwith processes that extend the lifespan of the material, \nsuch as repair, we would reduce the need for excess \nvirgin material extraction and emit fewer GHGs. We \nput this to the test in our roadmap to a well below \n2-degree world, which is presented in Chapter Four. \n*Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) is defined \nby the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat as a \n’greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and \nremovals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct human-\ninduced land use such as settlements and commercial uses, \nland-use change, and forestry activities.’ We include LULUCF \nbecause it is included in the Emissions Gap and because \nthey are important in the estimation of sustainably sourced \n(carbon-neutral)—and thus circular—biomass. \n23\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n22\n\n\nGlobal circularity & \nthe Emissions Gap\nBEHIND\nTHE\nMETRICS\nGAPS\n3\nMeasurements are critical to understanding \nthe world around us. Consistent measurement \nframeworks should inform governments and \nbusinesses alike to engage in uniform goal-setting \nand guide future action toward circularity and \nclimate mitigation in the most impactful way. \nIn last year’s Circularity Gap Report , we saw the \nglobal Circularity Metric go from 9.1% to 8.6%, \ndemonstrating the power of having a single, \noverarching metric to track progress and change. \nAnd now in this fourth edition of the Report, \nwe present robust, quantified evidence to show \nhow the circular economy and climate mitigation \nagenda are mutually reinforcing by using both \nthe Circularity Gap and the Emissions Gap to \nillustrate our case. What the findings tell us is that \ngovernments wanting to satisfy our societal needs \nand wants within healthy planetary boundaries \nneed a roadmap and fresh strategies.\nWHY THE CIRCULAR TRANSITIONS\nNEEDS METRICS\nWe need metrics and measurements to search for and \nidentify solutions and to help monitor and report our \nprogress in alleviating problems. Our Circularity Metric \nmeasures the circularity of the globe, and in providing \nan initial assessment of how wide the Circularity Gap \nis, the analysis provides an insight into where circular \nopportunities and priorities lie in material flows. By \nmeasuring circularity in this way, businesses and \ngovernments can track their circular performance over \ntime and put trends into context, as well as engage in \nuniform goal-setting and guide future action in the \nmost impactful way.\nTHE CIRCULARITY METRIC AND GAP\nThe circular economy is a big picture and holistic idea. \nUltimately, it is a means to an end—a socially just \nand ecologically safe space. Exactly how the circular \ntransition can deliver more beneficial social and \nenvironmental outcomes is not a question with just \none right answer however. There is no simple straight-\nline solution and the feedback loops in the system \nrun in all directions. 28 In particular, three connected \nspheres need to be taken into account: how resources \nare put to work to deliver social outcomes via \nprovisioning systems. Provisioning systems comprise \nof physical systems such as road infrastructure, \ntechnologies, and their efficiencies 29 and social \nsystems, which include government institutions, \nbusinesses, communities and markets. 30\nProvisioning systems are the essential link between \nbiophysical resource use and social outcomes. \nFor example, different forms of transportation \ninfrastructure (railways versus motorways or  \ncar-sharing versus car ownership) can generate  \nsimilar social outcomes, but at very different levels  \nof material use.\nIn capturing one overarching measurement of \ncircularity, we need to reduce this complexity \nsomewhat. So, we take the metabolism of the globe—\nhow materials flow through the economy and are in \nlong-term use—as the starting point. This approach \nbuilds on and is inspired by the work of Haas et al. 31 \n(2015). Taking the x-ray of the globe’s material use,  \nwe consider six fundamental dynamics of what the  \ncircular economy transition aims to establish and how  \nit can do so. This translates into two objectives and  \nfour strategies, which we base on the work of  \nBocken et al. (2016): 32 \n• Objective one:  Resource extraction from the \nlithosphere is minimised and biomass production \nand extraction is regenerative. \n• Objective two:  The dispersion and loss of \nmaterials is minimised, meaning all technical \nmaterials have high recovery opportunities, ideally \nwithout degradation and quality loss; emissions to \nair and dispersion to water or land is prevented; \nand biomass is optimally cascaded.\nThe four strategies we can use to achieve these \nobjectives are: \n• Narrow flows—Use less : The amount of material \nused or greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the \nmaking of a product or in the delivery of a service \nare decreased. This is through circular design \nor increasing the usage rates of materials and \nproducts. In practice: Sharing and rental models, \nmaterial lightweighting, multifunctional products \nor buildings, energy efficiency, digitisation.\n• Slow flows—Use longer : Resource use is optimised \nas the functional lifetime of goods is extended. \nDurable design, materials and service loops that \nextend life, such as repair and remanufacturing, \nboth contribute to slowing rates of extraction \nand use. In practice: Durable material use, \nmodular design, design for disassembly, repair, \nremanufacturing, refurbishing, renovation, \nremodelling. \n25\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n\n• Regenerate flows—Make clean: Fossil fuels, \npollutants and toxic materials are replaced with \nregenerative sources, thereby increasing and \nmaintaining value in natural ecosystems. In \npractice: Regenerative material use, renewable \nenergy, regenerative agriculture.\n• Cycle flows—Use again: The reuse of materials \nor products at end-of-life is optimised, facilitating \na circular flow of resources. This is enhanced with \nimproved collection and reprocessing of materials \nand optimal cascading by creating value in each \nstage of reuse. In practice: Design for recyclability \n(both technical and biological), design for \ndisassembly, recycling, waste-to-energy.\nIf we effectively deploy strategies focused on slowing , \nnarrowing , cycling  and regenerating  the flow of \nmaterials, we will ultimately require fewer materials \nto provide for similar needs. Because of this, fewer \nmaterials will be used by the economy, they will have \na longer lifespan and can be reused more effectively \nand with less harm caused to the environment. For our \nCircularity Metric to capture this crucial process, we \nmeasure the share of cycled materials as part of the \ntotal material inputs into a global economy. As such, it \nillustrates the current progress towards achieving the \ncircular economy’s ultimate goal of designing out waste \nthrough the four listed strategies.\nTHE EMISSIONS GAP\nFor a decade, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) has highlighted the Emissions \nGap every year. The Emissions Gap assesses the level \nof GHGs emitted if we continue to plunder along a \nbusiness-as-usual scenario that includes current \nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), compared \nto the level we must emit to stay on track to keep \nrising global temperature to 2-degrees, and ideally \n1.5-degrees. In the 2020 edition of the Report , launched \nin December 2020, seven scenarios are outlined \nspecifying the Gap under different policy settings \n(2010 policies, current policies, Unconditional NDCs, \nConditional NDCs) and under different goals (2-degree \ngoal, a 1.8-degree goal and a 1.5-degree goal). 33\nTHE EMISSIONS GAP IN THE CIRCULARITY \nGAP REPORT\nIt was in 2017 that we at Circle Economy took \ninspiration from the Emissions Gap Report and felt an \nequivalent for the use of materials was needed on a \nglobal stage. Then the Circularity Gap Report was born. \nThe Emissions Gap that is referred to in this Circularity \nGap Report  is defined in reference to a 1.75-degree \ntrajectory to be achieved by 2032 , thereby meeting \nthe goal of staying well below 2-degree of warming as \nspecified in the Paris Agreement. Where the NDCs and \ncurrent policies end, this Emissions Gap begins.\nTHE EMISSIONS GAP 2020\nAccording to the latest Emissions Gap Report , based \non a scenario of current Unconditional NDCs, \nglobal temperatures are estimated to rise by about \n3.2-degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. 34 \nCarbon dioxide emissions are predicted to fall by up to \n7% (between 2% and 12%) compared to 2019 emission \nlevels as a result of the pandemic slowdown. However, \natmospheric concentrations of GHGs continue to rise. \nThis is because the NDCs are ‘woefully inadequate’, \nstates the report. UNEP also looks at ways to bridge \nthe Gap—with the latest report summarising the scale \nof emerging net-zero emissions pledges made by \ncountries and exploring the potential of the lifestyle, \naviation and shipping sectors. \nIt also states that if we were to continue on a business-\nas-usual pathway, emissions could reach 65 billion \ntonnes CO2 equivalents by 2030 35 (see Figure Three \non page 38 for more information). In this scenario, we \nwould be faced with dangerous climate breakdown. \nThe climate policies already in place can deliver a \nreduction of 11 to 13 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalents. \nOf the remaining emissions, previous Circle Economy \nresearch estimated that circular economy strategies \ncould further close the Emissions Gap by about half. 36 \nThis report finds it delivers a huge reduction of 28.8 \nbillion tonnes and closes the Gap by more than 70%.\nTo read more about our methodologies, visit our \nwebsite circularity-gap.world .\nWHERE DOES OUR\nDATA COME FROM?\nOur study draws upon an increasingly broad research stream \nthat makes use of Environmentally-extended Multi-regional \nInput-Output Analysis (EE-MRIOA) to model the potential \nenvironmental impacts and benefits of the circular economy \nfrom a macroeconomic perspective. Relying on the EE-MRIO \ndatabase Exiobase v3.7, our methodology and underlying \nmodel is based on the same equation set of  two other \nprominent studies—Wood et al. (2017) 37 and Donati et al. \n(2020)38—with the exclusion of rebound effects. \nThe key features of our assessment are its life-cycle \nand consumption-based perspective as well as the use \nof modelling blueprints that revolve around changes in \nconsumption patterns (demand), production recipes (supply) \nand adoption rates in the form of either a partial increase, \nreduction or substitution, of products or services. The scope \nand data for our scenarios and interventions (displayed in \nChapter Four as the roadmap) build upon the work of Ivanova \net al. (2020) 39, Vita et al. (2019) 40, Moran et al. (2018) 41 and \nHertwich et al. (2018) 42, among others. \nOur input-output assessment measures the impact of \nchosen interventions and scenarios on the material and \ncarbon footprints of the globe, which we divided into three \ncountry profiles, namely: Grow, Build and Shift. A separate \nmodelling is carried out for quantifying flows of waste and \nsecondary materials based on a ‘light update’ of the hybrid \nExiobase v3.3.17 IOTs. Bringing this information together, \nthe Circularity Gap measures the share of virgin materials \nin the total material consumption, while the Emissions Gap \ngauges how much of the global GHG footprint still needs \nto be reduced in order to stay within the 1.5 and 2-degrees \nemissions pathways set by the IPCC.\nPhoto by Matthew DeVries\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n26\n\n\nTHE\nBRID-\nGING\nGAPS\n4\nNow that we have presented the current state of \nthe globe’s emissions and vast resource use, it is \ntime to analyse the findings and suggest a remedy. \nIn this chapter, we explore the transformative \npower of circular economy strategies to ensure \nintelligent material use, tackle overconsumption \nand slash greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They \ngo further than the current policies and national \nclimate pledges dare to go. Moving beyond \nrenewable and efficient energy, they draw from a \ndeeper body of circular interventions;  calling for \nsystemic transformation coupled with behavioural \nchange. Nested within our roadmap are ‘what-if’ \nscenarios, which have been based on strategies \nthat ultimately narrow, slow, regenerate or \ncycle material flows across societal needs and \nwants. They ultimately have a major effect on \nmanaging climate and world resource use, such \nthat the impact trends fall back within planetary \nboundaries. The broader ambition is that these \ndirections facilitate and trigger concerted action \nand the formation of global and local coalitions to \nadvance ideas across sectors, supply chains, cities \nand regions.\nSCENARIOS FOR THE WORLD\nThere is a long history of sketching scenarios to \nreform the global economy, with the Club of Rome’s \nreport, Limits to Growth , in 1972 providing a landmark \nin this tradition. The message of this book still rings \ntrue today: the earth’s resources cannot sustain \ncurrent rates of economic and population growth \nmuch beyond the year 2100. We’ve witnessed the \npublication of scenarios in this field since then. \nThey’ve ranged from considering the near-term and \nincremental change, which is symptomatic of many of \nthe Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), while \nothers take a more transformational approach with an \neye on systemic change. This includes the approach \nour Circularity Gap Reports take. With scenarios rooted \nin the circular economy, there is a clear need for \nurgent transformation of how we produce, design and \nconsume within our economies. \nNO COUNTRY IS FINISHED DEVELOPING \nHow could we not call for transformational and \nsystemic change? Last year, our report posited that \nwhen it comes to reaching the ecologically safe 43 \nand socially just 44 space, all countries are failing. We \nare all developing countries. On the global stage, we \ncontinue to consume too much and to drive climate \nbreakdown with increasing levels of GHG emissions \nfrom our activities. Marking a turning point in 2020, \nthe International Energy Agency’s (IEA) flagship World \nEnergy Outlook  report 45—which typically set the tone \nof the climate debate—laid out an aggressive action \nplan for countries. For the first time, it went beyond \nfocusing on the renewable energy transition and \ncalled for behavioural overhauls across all populations \nthat enjoy access to modern energy. Clearly, from \nproduction to consumption, the alarm is heard: we \nneed to change. \nSOCIAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nOf course, 2020 was a year like no other for many of us. \nAs the pandemic threatened the livelihoods of billions, \ncalls for systemic transformation were everywhere, \nwhile narratives around ‘building back better’ and ‘the \ngreat reset’ ushered in a real sense of opportunity. \nThis time, our responses must match the scale of the \nclimate, social and economic emergency—in a way \nthat reduces global and local inequality and protects \nagainst climate breakdown. Therefore it is imperative \nto add strings to our bow and incorporate social \nand ethical considerations in the circular economy \ntransition. Any successful economic model must meet \nthe needs of the society it serves while responsibly \nstewarding the natural systems upon which it is reliant. \nIt is a matter of striking a harmonious balance between \npeople and planet.  \nIt’s also imperative to remember who will drive the \ncircular transition on the ground: human capital. \nInitially, the circular economy transition is expected \nto be labour-intensive. This is because the core pillars \nbehind preserving a material’s maximum value, for \nas long as possible (reuse, repair, remanufacture and \nrecycling), hinge on processes that typically require \nmore labour than in the linear economy where \nresources are often wasted and incinerated 4647. With \nthe introduction of new design strategies, production \nprocesses and business models, the type of work that \nwill be undertaken will be reshaped, thereby creating \nnew jobs, transforming existing ones and phasing \nout others. This change will require skills from across \nthe spectrum, where we need to pay equal attention \nto practically- and theoretically-skilled workers and \nensure that workers are protected and don’t fall foul \nto the same explotiations as in the linear economy. A \ncircular economy transition that is mindful of social \nand ethical issues is one for which we should all strive.\nOur roadmap to a well  \nbelow 2-degree world\nPhoto by Edho Fitrah \n29\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n\nSOCIETY CENTRAL, RESOURCE SMART, \nCLIMATE-SAFE SCENARIOS\nIn creating a roadmap to a well below 2-degree reality \nfor the globe, its complexity needs to be taken into \naccount. The nine planetary boundaries framework, \nwhich includes biodiversity loss, climate change and \nland system change 48, provides guidance here. In our \nanalysis, however, we spotlight two aspects in one \nstrategy: climate mitigation through the intelligent \nmanagement of the globe’s resources. In this way, \nwe don’t explicitly engage with the other planetary \nboundaries, but this allows us to focus on scenarios  \nthat can point us in the direction of a safe and just \nspace. We use the Circularity Gap and the Emissions  \nGap as goals to guide us in building our scenarios for  \nthe roadmap.\nTo construct our roadmap and the scenarios it holds, \nwe look at the seven societal needs and wants (see page \n17). Taking this consumption approach, we are able to \nexamine ethical considerations and trade-offs that could \npotentially arise in the transition to circularity. We are \naware that resources are increasingly used to not only \nsatisfy societal needs, but also wants. 49 Consider this: \nalthough a healthy diet requires 2,000 kcal per day for  \na typical female, the intake in some countries may be  \nfar higher, while malnutrition persists in others.  \nThe more calorie intensive diets could consist of  \nout-of-season, imported foods that have travelled \nacross the globe, or high levels of animal protein.  \nCalling to reduce consumption here may be appropriate \nand even ethical, but less so in cases where access to \nbasic nutritious food is limited. The circular economy \nis also about achieving a structural and cultural shift \nwhere we can all satisfy universal needs—so there \nare important differences to take into consideration. \nIn being a means to an end of a safe and just space, \nthe circular economy must consider that different \napproaches or tactics must prevail in different contexts \nto ensure local needs are met and that a reduction in \noverconsumption, for example, is encouraged. We apply \nthis thinking in Chapter Six and Seven when we consider \nour three country profiles: Build, Grow and Shift.\nIt’s worth noting that the scenarios within our roadmap \nare ‘what-if’ scenarios: they serve as an ambitious \nexploration of a potential path forward and sketch \nwhich type of interventions and levers are most \nimpactful. They are not, however, grounded in political \nrealities. They do provide a qualitative assessment \nof the implementation timeframe, but they are not \nquantitatively modelled year-by-year.\nA POWERFUL STARTING POINT: THE NDCS\nFollowing three decades—since the Earth Summit \nin Rio de Janeiro in 1992—of global coordination \non climate change, the majority of nations have \nput forward plans to get our planet back on a safe \ntrajectory: the NDCs. These targets are not static, \none-off commitments; they are long-term and require \ninvestment, time and tracking. However, multiple \nreports and progress-checks 50 have found that these \nplans will not only probably be missed but that they—\neven at the onset—never went far enough to keep us \non a below 2-degree path. This highlights the need \nfor interventions that go far beyond the NDCs, and \nencapsulates the drivers behind our research: the \ntransition to a circular economy can contribute further \nto climate change mitigation than the strategies \ncountries are currently employing. \nFor this reason, we have excluded circular \ninterventions that were commonly mentioned in \ncountries’ first NDCs. While only the transition to \nrenewable energy was mentioned in the majority (57%) \nof NDCs—albeit at varying degrees of detail—other \ninterventions such as ‘energy efficient appliances’ \nand ‘shift to public transport’ also appeared fairly \nfrequently. For this reason, none of these strategies \nhave been directly included in our analysis.  \nBy prioritising in this way, we hope to demonstrate  \nthe additional potential and impact our scenarios will \nhave in keeping us on track to meet the goals of the \nParis Agreement. \n \nWHY\nIn developing circular interventions to transform  \nhow we fulfil our societal needs and wants, we  \nuse the four circular flow strategies as a base (see  25).  \nBut how do they tackle both GHG emissions and  \nmaterial footprints?\nNARROW,\nBy minimising the overall material inputs into an economy, \nthe emissions present in resources and, therefore, end \nproducts will be lower. This can be strengthened if priority \nis given to the flows with the highest embodied emissions.\nREGENERATE,\nIn using regenerative resources, the high levels of \nemissions in fossil fuels and unsustainable biomass  \nare cut from the economy\nSLOW,\nIn extending the functional lifetime of resources,  \nthe emissions attached to individual material flows  \nare spread out and therefore minimised over time.\nCYCLE?\nDepending on the energy used and emissions released \nduring cycling, this strategy has the potential to  \neliminate embodied emissions from inputs.\n31\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n30\n\n\nHOUSING\nHousing leads the way in guzzling resources and \nproducing emissions to satisfy our need for shelter. \nWhen it comes to the environmental impact of a sector \nas economically and socially significant as Housing, \nwe must use less, by narrowing flows. This can be \nachieved through ultimately building fewer, but \nbetter, new houses and multi-occupancy dwellings, \nto reduce overall floor space and optimise resource \nefficiency. However, before we build new buildings,  \nwe should prioritise extending the lifetime of \nexisting stock.\nCore interventions include banning building with \nvirgin materials  and simultaneously introducing \npolicies to cap residential stock expansion in line \nwith available Construction and Demolition Waste \n(C&DW). This strategy assumes all C&DW is diverted \nas a secondary material for residential construction, \nbut only half is fit for purpose (high uncertainty). It \nalso factors in the rate of demolition as a determinant \nof material flow volumes. In short, new construction \nis constrained by the secondary materials that \nbecome available.\nIn slowing flows, more co-housing, increased \nrenovation, refurbishment, modular design  that can \neasily adapt to needs over time is needed, and  \nre-occupancy of underused and disused buildings  \nto meet housing demand within global stock limits. \nOptimising flexible and multi-functional space  \nfor non-residential purposes also frees up existing \nstock for (redesignation as) housing. In addition, the \nreduction in total floorspace delivers proportional \nsavings on heating and cooling; while this is enhanced \nwith avenues to cut energy consumption, such as lower \nroom temperatures, smart metering and improved \nthermal insulation. Retrofitting existing housing \nstock will both slow flows by extending the lifespan \nand in some cases cycle flows through reuse of \nmaterials in renovation and refurbishment on-site (as \ndoes the specification of recycled or circular materials \nin general construction).\nNature-inspired solutions can also lower material \nand energy demand by narrowing  and regenerating  \nflows. Low-energy approaches such as Passivhaus \ndesign (minimising requirements for mechanical space \nheating, cooling and ventilation) can narrow flows, \nwhile applying renewable technologies  such as solar \nphotovoltaic or thermal, air-source and geothermal \nheat pumps , can regenerate flows and shrink the \ncarbon footprint of a property. The use of low-carbon \nconstruction materials, lightweighting and local \nsourcing all help to cut embodied energy. Natural  \nor renewable building materials , such as wood, \nstraw and hemp, help regenerate flows as well.  \nGreen roofs and living walls are all examples of \ninterventions with regenerative benefits, at least in \nterms of thermal performance, water management, \nbiodiversity and air quality.\nFinally, other impactful interventions that can cycle \nflows include modern methods of construction  \nsuch as modular and offsite design, plus design for \nmanufacture and assembly . As well as carrying the \npotential for deconstruction, relocation and reuse \nof elements (or even whole buildings), factory-built \noptions boost resource efficiency in production and \nperformance.\nNUTRITION\nIn such a resource- and emissions-intensive need, \ntackling food shortages and scarcity starts first with \noptimising how we use the food we already have at our \ndisposal, before looking to increase production. Here, \nthe notion of ‘sustainable biomass’—which is produced \nand sourced sustainably (meaning carbon-neutral) 51, \nand therefore circular—is also very important as food \nconstitutes a large proportion of it globally.\nCutting excess consumption  is a critical means to \nnarrow flows. Interventions around food sufficiency—\nfor instance, via reductions in per capita caloric and \nprotein daily uptake rates in Shift countries, bringing \nthem down to match Grow country levels (see more \non page 50)—can also result in secondary benefits \nsuch as less packaging. In our roadmap, slashing \nexcess consumption implies keeping caloric supply \n(not consumption) under 3,000 kcal per person, per \nday, reducing packaging in the food supply chain \nby 55%, and reducing food waste (household) and \nlosses (supply chain).  Further narrow interventions \ninclude footprint-per-calorie reductions  which \ncan be achieved through changes in diet ; largely \nthe uptake of vegan  and healthier  options. Given a \nfocus on constant caloric and protein intake, a move \naway from foods with low nutritional value, such as \nsugary beverages and refined, heavily processed food \ncan be impactful. Unprocessed food  is championed, \nalongside an ongoing decrease in consumption of all \nmeat, fish and dairy, with a target of 100% eradication \nof unhealthy high-sugar, high-salt products.\nSustainable food production  represents another \nsignificant avenue. Fresh, regional, local and seasonal \noptions on the menu mean less need for hot-housing \nvegetables, which equates to a reduction in fuel \ninputs, plus fewer food miles and lower transportation \nimpacts. Urban, organic  and precision farming  \nmodels would also eliminate synthetic fertiliser use.\nBacked by carbon-neutral biomass certification, \nsubstituting food waste and losses for fodder crops  \nwill support growth of secondary markets, helping to \ncycle flows.\nImprovements to food preparation resources and \npractices would bring benefits to public health, as well \nas energy consumption. Key interventions include \nthe replacement of polluting traditional biomass and \nblack-carbon-producing stoves with clean cooking  \napparatuses, including advanced solar-electric stoves, \nthat would regenerate flows.\nMOBILITY\nWith its mammoth footprint, Mobility is commonly \nassociated in the minds of both policymakers and the \npublic with GHG emissions reduction. From driving to \nflying, opportunities for change are plentiful.\nAs evidenced during the global pandemic’s regional \nlockdowns, the obvious way to narrow flows is simply \nto reduce travel . This reduction can be achieved \nthrough a range of interventions, including the \nprovision of regional and local hubs, shared and \nvirtual offices, telecommuting  and working from \nhome. The optimisation of supply chain logistics also \nrepresents an opportunity for multiple resource-\nefficiency wins in terms of waste minimisation,  \ncargo miles  and infrastructure cost . Vehicle design \nimprovements  are another more incremental way to \nnarrow flows, with lightweighting and smaller sizes  \nof mobility vehicles such as cars and scooters,  \nresulting in a reduced requirement for steel \nand aluminium production, as well as lower fuel \nconsumption and embodied energy. Autonomous \nvehicles  (driverless cars), as well as electric bicycles  \npromise Mass-Carbon savings, too. When it comes to \nprioritising durable design  and material selection, \nplus optimising repairability and maximising \nmaintenance , we can also slow flows, thereby \nextending the lifetime of vehicles.\nAs well as better vehicles, better utilisation of all \nvehicles  will further narrow flows. With personal \nvehicle ownership no longer the dream it once seemed, \ninterventions include shared mobility , via car clubs \nand pools, ride-sharing , as well as public transport , \nwith park-and-ride provision to cut fuel consumption 52.\nFinally, optimising end-of-life vehicle management  \nis critical to cycle flows, with the recycling of metal and \nplastic components, and the use of recycled material, \non the rise. \nCOMMUNICATION\nEfficient design and use of communication \nequipment , especially by way of digitalisation , can \nnarrow flows. Consider the large reduction in printed \nmaterials as the trends towards e-books and online \nnews platforms gained ground. Interventions include \nthe sharing of equipment and tools , plus cloud \ncomputing services, which help avoid a trade-off \nin terms of proliferation of impacts from personal \ncomputing and mobile electronic devices. Simply \nbuying smaller and lighter  laptops instead of  \ndesktop computers with LCD monitors can mean \nresource consumption is reduced and resource \nefficiency enhanced.\n33\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n32\n\n\nCONSUMABLES\nWith Consumables, such as paper, textiles, plastic, \nfurniture and electronics, we need to use less, or \nnarrow flows, which revolves around efficient \ndesign and use of consumer products . By shifting \nconsumption choices and mainstreaming circular \ndesign, we can impact both usage and acquisition \nrates. Tangible interventions include: increasing \ndigitisation  to reduce paper use; not making textiles \nfrom animals ; aiming to eradicate single-use plastic ; \noptimising usage of electronics  to minimise e-waste; \nspecifying only eco-labelled responsibly-sourced \ntimber furniture ; and prioritising local purchasing \nand sourcing . \nIn slowing flows, which revolves around the design of \ndurable consumer products , interventions include \nintroducing and encouraging repair, maintenance, \nsharing, re-manufacturing  and take-back \nprogrammes for textiles, appliances, furniture  \nand machinery . Options such as the elimination \nof planned or built-in obsolescence , investment \nin higher-quality production to extend life-\nexpectancy  of goods, plus design for disassembly , \ncustomisation  and replacement parts  are \nall practical and marketable. \nThe use of sustainable material can also regenerate \nflows by eliminating toxins and pollutants , plus has \nthe potential to support the provision of chemical-free \nchoices to consumers. Interventions include improved \nefficiency and ongoing reduction of chemical use in \nconsumer products through the adoption of biobased \nalternatives, chemicals leasing  and selection of \nnatural fertilisers  and organic compost in gardens .\nFacilitating reuse by cycling flows will maximise the \nuptake of circular materials in Consumables that close \nloops and boost value in secondary markets . Key \ninterventions include promoting recycling of plastics , \nsynthetic fibres, paper, wood and by-products; \nalso specifying recycled content obligations , plus \nsubstituting where possible for virgin or raw material.\nHEALTHCARE \nAlthough the total potential impact of circular \nHealthcare interventions is small compared to some \nof the other societal needs and wants, there are \nnevertheless multiple benefits to be realised. For \ninstance, investment in longer-lasting medical \nequipment , with planned preventive maintenance \nregimes  in place, can not only extend asset lifetimes \nthrough cascading but also reduce the number of \nsingle-use plastic items in production and use—so \nserving to simultaneously narrow, slow and cycle flows.\nThe development of virtual healthcare service \nmodels is another avenue where interventions can \nnarrow flows. Access to diagnosis and treatment can \nbe improved, whilst concurrently reducing the need \nfor physical consultation spaces and all the associated \nresource consumption costs, including travel \nimpacts. Combining Healthcare and Communication \ninterventions in this way delivers environmental, \nsocial, and economic sustainability benefits.\nSERVICES\nIn our recommendations, we do not include \ninterventions relating specifically to the societal need \nof Services, as the materials used and emissions \nreleased in performing such Services are included in \nother categories. For example, repair interventions—\nclassified as a service—are addressed under most of \nthe other needs and wants. \n35\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n34\n\n\nA\nNEW\nSET-\nTING\nCOURSE\n5\nTo get the global economy on a pathway towards \ncircularity and a well below 2-degree world, major \ncourse-corrections are needed. This section \nhighlights the extent to which our roadmap \n(presented in Chapter Four) is able to mitigate \nclimate breakdown and curb material use globally:  \nin other words how effective they are in  \nMass-Carbon terms. This chapter also showcases \nsome of the dominant climate mitigation  \nnarratives out there: an urgent timeframe and  \na clear temperature goal. \nNO ROOM FOR BUSINESS-AS-USUAL \nMaterial extraction has fuelled economic progress since \nthe Industrial Revolution, at the same time causing \nhuman-made greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Over \nthe last five decades, the global extraction of materials \nmore than tripled, from 26.7 billion tonnes in 1970, to \n92.1 billion tonnes in 2017. 53 And as we revealed in our \n2020 report, more than 100 billion tonnes of materials \nnow enter our economy. Material use is accelerating; \nand with this comes increased GHG emissions—now \ntotaling 59.1 billion tonnes. 54\nExceptionally in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic resulted \nin worldwide lockdowns. As people were restricted \nto their homes, a hefty dent was made in the annual \nemissions bill: at the lowest point global CO 2 was 7% \n(between 2% and 12%) lower than in 2019. 55 This was the \nlowest level since 2010. However, little has been done \nto prevent a rapid rebound in emissions as countries \nbegan opening up after both the first and second wave. \nTo put emissions into a structural decline, large shifts \nin government policies will have to take place. The \nEmissions Gap Report  2020 found that a green pandemic \nrecovery 56 could shave 25% off the emissions we would \nsee with the current pre-covid policies in place. And \nnow we are armed with new knowledge: faced with \nthe necessary urgency we can rapidly change our \nbehaviours almost overnight. And, ultimately, climate \nbreakdown will be the biggest global health threat  \nof the century. 57\nMaking our economies more resource-efficient will, \nin turn, reduce GHG emissions along the value-\nchain— from the mines from which raw materials are \nsourced and the fields in which produce is grown, to \nmanufacturing and retail via last-mile logistics.  \nThis exponential potential for a global reset crosses all \nborders which demarcate national climate commitments \nand favours intensifying cooperation along supply \nchains, thereby closing local material cycles. \nThe transformational  \nimpact of circularity\nPhoto by Mike Erskine \n37\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n\nMATERIAL EXTRACTION \n& GHG TRAJECTORY\nFigure Three shows the development for material \nextraction (Mass) in billion tonnes (Gt) and GHG \nemissions in carbon dioxide equivalents (Carbon) from \n1900 to 2019 and projected to 2050, including the \ntransformational impact of our circular roadmap.\n*The carbon budget was set at 800 billion tonnes of CO 2 \nequivalents. Assuming emissions remained equal for  \n2018-2020, this budget has been depleted by 167 billion tonnes \nCO 2 equivalents—leaving 633 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalents \nremaining. At our current annual rate of emissions, it would \ntake us just a little over a decade to blaze through this 633 \nbillion tonnes budget; highlighting how urgent an initial \ncurtailing of emissions is. The sooner we begin, the more time \nwe have to reach the ultimate goal—net-zero. \nFigure Three  shows the trajectory that could be \nachieved if our roadmap is implemented and backed \nby strong action that honours NDC commitments. \nUnder a ‘current policies’ scenario we will likely reach \n60 billion tonnes of GHG emissions by 2030. With \nthe adoption of the (unconditional) NDCs this will go \ndown to 56 billion tonnes by 2030. Implementation \nof the interventions we suggest will bring this down \nfurther to reach 33.2 billion tonnes of CO 2eq by 2030, \nwhich is on trajectory towards net-zero by 2044. In \nshort, between business-as-usual and our scenario by \n2030, the NDCs could 15% of the solution whereas our \nroadmap can deliver the additional 85% needed. This \nillustrates, again, the transformational character of the \ninterventions proposed in this report.\nOur global carbon budget 58 in 2018—the cumulative \namount of CO 2eq emissions permitted over a period of \ntime to stay within a certain temperature threshold—\nto keep warming well below 2-degrees has already \ndepleted by 21%. * At our current annual rate of \nemissions, it would take us just a little over a decade to \nblaze through the remaining  budget—highlighting the \nurgency of an initial curtailing of emissions. The sooner \nwe begin, the more time we have to reach the ultimate \ngoal—net-zero. \nIf we assume that emissions will decline from 2021 \nonwards at a linear rate, we are given the gift of more \ntime. Staying within the desired well below 2-degree \nlimit will be possible in this scenario if we reach net-\nzero emissions by 2044, upping the previous deadline \nby more than a decade. To realise this scenario, though, \nwe must implement all NDC pledgesand all proposed \ncircular strategies in our roadmap by 2030—and then \ncarry that momentum forward until 2044. \nIS A FULLY CIRCULAR  \nECONOMY POSSIBLE?\nHuge dynamics at play across the globe \nrepresent barriers to us closing the \nCircularity Gap to the same extent we can \nclose the Emissions Gap. These include:\nStock build-up and operation.  \nCountries are continually investing in \nnew buildings and infrastructure, such \nas to provide Mobility and Housing, as \nwell as renewable energy. This stock \nbuild-up is not inherently bad; many \ncountries need to invest to ensure that \nthe local populations have access to basic \nservices, particularly in Build and Grow \ncountries (Chapter Six), as well as build-\nup infrastructure globally to support \nrenewable energy generation, distribution \nand storage capacity. These resources \nwould remain locked away and not \navailable for cycling, and therefore weigh \ndown the Circularity Metric.\nMaterial quality loss.  Even in an ideal \ncircular system, some primary resource \nextraction would still exist. This is \nbecause there is always a loss of material \nquantity or quality in the process of \ncycling, which we need to compensate \nfor by adding new virgin materials either \ndirectly or in the form of energy.  \n56\n31\n20442018\n7\n1900-2050\nCARBON TRAJECTORIES\nCurrent trajectory  80Gt\nThe Earth is 3 to 6-degrees warmer\nCurrent trajectory  177Gt\nBy 2050\nmass trajectory\nprojected mass trajectory\nmass projection range\nNDC trajectory  56Gt\nThe Earth is 2 to 3-degrees warmer\nNDC + CE trajectory: The Earth \nis only 1.75-degrees warmer\nCarbon dioxide equivalent \nemissions in billion tonnes \n(Gt CO 2 eq)\nCARBON\n92\n7\nMaterial extraction\nin billion tonnes (Gt)\nMASS\n1900\n28\n1970\n27\n2032\ncarbon trajectory\nprojected carbon trajectory\ncarbon projection range\n 56\n31\n20442018\n7\n1900-2050\nCARBON TRAJECTORIES\nCurrent trajectory  80Gt\nThe Earth is 3 to 6-degrees warmer\nCurrent trajectory  177Gt\nBy 2050\nmass trajectory\nprojected mass trajectory\nmass projection range\nNDC trajectory  56Gt\nThe Earth is 2 to 3-degrees warmer\nNDC + CE trajectory: The Earth \nis only 1.75-degrees warmer\nCarbon dioxide equivalent \nemissions in billion tonnes \n(Gt CO 2 eq)\nCARBON\n92\n7\nMaterial extraction\nin billion tonnes (Gt)\nMASS\n1900\n28\n1970\n27\n2032\ncarbon trajectory\nprojected carbon trajectory\ncarbon projection range\nEven if countries meet all the targets laid out in NDCs—\nmost of which have been deemed insufficient, highly \ninsufficient or critically insufficient 59—emissions will \nnot drop, but rather stabilise up to 2030. This is where \ncircular strategies come into play, carrying us the rest \nof the way to a net-zero world by 2050. Yet, at present, \nmany countries are not on track to meet their climate \ngoals; and the uptake of circular strategies is occurring \nat a slower pace than is needed. \n39\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n38\n\n\nFigure xx shows the impact of our interventions on the \nCircularity and Emissions Gaps\nTHE SOLUTION SPACE SUMMARISED\nFigure Four on the next page shows how our roadmap \n21 interventions across six scenarios—one for each \nof the six societal needs we model—can mitigate \nclimate impact by curbing GHG emissions. The \nroadmap sketches interventions that move beyond \nincremental action and provides solutions that will \nrequire behavioural change (dietary shifts towards \nless meat consumption, for example) and the \nadoption of state-of-the-art technologies in industry \nto mitigate emissions in hard to abate sectors (such \nas steel manufacturing). It illustrates how continued \nglobalisation can benefit from the uptake of digital \nsolutions. The combined interventions showcase the \nmitigation potential that begins where the current \ncountry pledges end; illustrating the additional impact \nour interventions can bring to the NDCs. In short, the \ninterventions provide input for a more profound and \nfundamental transformation than the more current \npathways that make up the vast majority of NDCs. \nFor each intervention, Figure Four shows its \npotential to reduce GHG emissions as the width of \nthe intervention ‘box’, and the material footprint \nreduction by the height of the box. The image shows \nthe contribution of each intervention separately, as \nwell as for all interventions combined. What is visible \nis that some interventions overlap, which means that \nthe total effect when we consider certain interventions \noverlapping is significantly less than when all individual \ninterventions are combined, yet ignoring the overlap. \nThis is because some interventions, when combined, \nwill partially cancel each other out. For example, in \n‘Reduce floor space’, we also reduce the volumes \nof construction and demolition waste (C&DW) that \nbecome available for recycling and repurposing. \nAnother example is the overlap between various  \nsmart transport solutions (‘Reduce travel’,  \n‘Circular vehicles’, for example), whose impact is \nmodelled to narrow the footprint of Mobility.  \nThe absolute impact of lightweighting the global \ncar fleet in ‘Vehicle design improvements’ is directly \nmoderated by the size of the said fleet, which in turn \nis reduced by, for instance, car sharing. This dynamic \nbetween interventions and the extent of their overlaps \nis visually depicted by the boxes.\nThe Figure shows the sheer difference in the \nemissions- and material-reduction power between \ninterventions. Echoing our findings from the \nemissions x-ray presented in Chapter Two, it’s clear \nthat the societal needs that currently generate most \nemissions—Housing, Mobility and Nutrition—also \nshow the biggest need, and in fact, opportunity, to \nreduce impacts.  \nTogether, the combined interventions can almost \ndouble the current global Circularity Metric of 8.6%, \nbringing it to 17%. In temperature terms, we can stay \nbelow a 2-degrees warming scenario if we implement \nall segments of the roadmap, as well as conditional \nand unconditional NDCs by 2032, and then continue \ndecreasing emissions at more or less the same pace to \nreach net-zero by 2050. \nINTERVENTIONS\nVORTEX\nFigure Four shows the impact of our interventions  \non the Circularity and Emissions Gaps\n-0.7\nINTERVENTIONS\nVORTEX\n \n \nSustainable\nfoodproduction\nReducetravel\nImprove\nvehicle\nutilisation\nResource\neﬃcient\nconstruction\n‘Natural’housingsolutions\nCleancooking\nstoves\nReduction\nexcess\nconsumption\n1.8°C\n3.2°C\nResource \neﬃcient\nhousing\n-0\n.9\nCircular\nvehicles\nVehicles\ndurability\nVehicles\ndesign\nimprovements\nEﬃcient\ndesign\n& use\nof ICTs\nCircular\nhealthcaresystem\nDurable\nconsumerproducts\nEﬃcient design\n& use of\nconsumerproducts\nCircularconsumables\nChemi-cals free\n-3.4\n-3.4\n-6.5\n-1.3\n-1.5\n-1.8\n-2.4-1\n-1.3\n-1.2\n-1\n-0.3-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.5\n-0.4\nCircular \nconstruction materials\n-1.1\n-3.5\n-3.4\nIncreasehousing\ndurability\nReduceﬂoor\nspace\n-2.1\n-3.2\n-5.3\n-8.4\n-4\n-3.1\n-0 .5\n-2.5\n-1.2\n-2.2\n-3.3\n-1.6\n-2\n-0 .8\n-0.3\n-0.3\n-0\n.3\n-2.1\n-2\nHealthy \ndiet\n \n         C\nO\nN\nS\nU\nM\nA\nB\nL\nE\nINTERVENTIONS \nVORTEX\n \n \nSustainable\nfoodproduction\nReducetravel\nImprove\nvehicle\nutilisation\nResource\nefficient\nconstruction\n‘Natural’housingsolutions\nCleancooking\nstoves\nReduction\nexcess\nconsumption\n-3.1°C\n-1.8°C\nResource \nefficient\nhousing\nCircular\nvehicles\nVehicles\ndurability\nVehicles\ndesign\nimprovements\nEfficient\ndesign\n& use\nof ICTs\nCircular\nhealthcaresystem\nDurable\nconsumerproducts\nEfficient design\n& use of\nconsumerproducts\nCircularconsumables\nChemi-cals free\nHealthy \ndiet\n \n \nWIDTH \nexpresses the emissions\nreduction  in GtCO 2eq\nHEIGHT \nexpresses the material \nmass  reduction in Gt\nCOLOUR\nrepresents a societal need:\nMOBILITY CONSUMABLES\nHEALTHCARE COMMUNICATIONS\nNUTRITION HOUSING\nCircular \nconstruction materials\nIncreasehousing\ndurability\nReducefloor\nspace\n-3.1°C-1.8°C\nTEMPERATURE\ntotal reduction in global \ntemperature increase \nby 2050\nCOLOUR\nrepresents a societal need:\nMOBILITY\nCONSUMABLES\nHEALTHCARE\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nNUTRITION\nHOUSING\n1.8°C3.2°C\nTEMPERATURE\ntotal mitigation of expected global\ntemperature increase by 2050\n \nWIDTH\nexpresses the emissions\nreduction in Gt CO2 eq\nHEIGHT \nexpresses the materialmass\n reduction in Gt\n-∞\n40\n\n\nof both interventions (slow and cycle); both have a \ncrucial role to play in closing the Circularity Gap, which \ncan only occur if all demand for construction materials \nis met by secondary materials, which is technically \nchallenging. (For more information refer to the text \nbox on page 39).\nSYNERGISTIC INTERVENTIONS\nThe reality is that the fastest route to achieving climate \nchange mitigation hinges on substantial reductions in \nour overall use of materials. In particular, those that \nhave the highest embodied emissions—namely, fossil \nfuels and sustainably produced biomass. The logic \nfollows that interventions that focus on using less have \na substantial impact on closing both the Gaps. \nHousing  leads as the societal need with the most \nsynergistic potential. There are a few main reasons \nbehind this. Firstly, it has a gigantic contribution to \nresource extraction. Secondly, it makes abundant use \nof carbon-intensive materials such as cement and \nsteel, heavily produces direct emissions from space \nheating and cooling (which can be diminished by a \nshift to renewable energy) and lastly is dominant in \nthe generation of waste and potential for secondary \nmaterial supply in the form of C&DW. With circular \nstrategies, 9.5 billion tonnes of C&DW could be \ndiverted from landfill. This is over four times the total \nglobal municipal solid waste (2.1 billion tonnes). The \ninterventions we applied to the second most impactful \nsocietal need of Nutrition  appear to have a slightly \ngreater impact on the Emissions Gap. This is not \nentirely surprising, as most of the sector is related to \necological, rather than technical, cycling (biomass). \nMoving to clean cooking stoves and healthy diets has a \nsofter impact, while reducing excess consumption and \nsustainable farming stand out for their strong effect on \nboth the Circularity and Emissions Gap, respectively.\nThe remaining societal needs Health, Communication  \nand Consumables  have a noticeably lower impact on \nclosing both Gaps. Consumables scenarios, defined by \nefficient product design and use, were less impactful \non the whole, having a higher relative impact on \ncircularity than emissions. As noted, the only product \ngroup to have a significant influence on both Gaps \nwas that of chemicals and chemical products—while \nmore common consumer items, from furniture and \nappliances to paper and plastic, had a more modest \neffect. However, this doesn’t mean these categories \nshould be ignored, as these interventions cover the \nproducts that final consumers can most easily engage \nwith. Circular consumption models will inevitably \nhave knock-on effects at a systems level, in addition \nto being within the reach of individuals to drive the \nchange. However, in tailoring this treatment plan to \ncountry profiles we will move forward by focussing on \nNutrition, Mobility, Housing  and the enabling space \nof waste management .\nGLOBAL EMISSIONS SLASHED BY 39% \nFrom a global warming perspective—and with the \naim of closing the Emissions Gap—our circular \nscenarios have the potential to cut 39% of total \nglobal emissions . Breaking this down, we see that the \nsocietal need for Mobility  is the largest contributing \n‘consumption category’, although Housing  and \nNutrition  also have huge mitigation power.\nAbout two-thirds of the reduction in emissions is \nattributable to our interventions—detailed on pages \n32 to 34 and in Figure Four—that tackle supply chain \nemissions (a reduction of 14.8 billion tonnes). These \nalso serve to reduce overall consumption, for example \nthrough shared mobility concepts, or by reducing \noverall floorspace and increasing the durability of \nbuildings. Only one-third of the emissions reduction is \nlinked to reducing the direct emissions from Mobility  \n(emissions released while driving) by reducing travel, \nlowering heating and cooling needs within Housing  by \napplying green building strategies, for example, and \navoiding all emissions associated with human activities \nin Nutrition  that take place on agricultural land, \nforested land, wetland or peatland, such as cutting \ndown forests or ploughing grasslands; land use, land-\nuse change and forestry (LULUCF).\nDespite the overarching impact of reducing global \nsupply chain emissions as a whole, we see that the \nmitigation potential of each societal need and want \nvaries. In providing Housing  to the global population, \n82% of emission reductions are related to the material \nside—the supply chain of construction materials—\nand to energy use in commercial and industrial \nbuildings. Just 18% of the mitigation potential lies \nenergy combustion for residential heating and hot \nwater. Meanwhile, for Mobility , the majority (52%) of \nemission reductions relate to the supply chain and \ncommercial fleet operation: design and manufacturing \ninterventions, such as integrating circularity into \nvehicle design, as opposed to diffused emissions  \nfrom driving. \nFor Nutrition , over 70% of mitigation potential can \nbe attributed to how we use and value our land: \nLULUCF. The remaining 27% of emissions come \nfrom the supply chain—such as transporting crops \nfrom farms to traders. Our interventions can reduce \nLULUCF emissions by 75%—from 4.1 billion tonnes \nto only 1 billion tonne (high uncertainty). As global \npopulations and appetites grow, more land is needed \nfor crop cultivation—especially for livestock feed—\nand pasture land for raising animals. This drives \ndeforestation which is hugely polluting, devastating \nfor local biodiversity, and cuts the natural carbon \nabsorption capacity of forests. Avoiding deforestation \nwith sustainably farmed or managed biomass is a \nhuge enabler, as our Nutrition  scenario denotes, as \nis shrinking the footprint of our diets by reducing our \nconsumption of meat proteins.\nRESOURCE EXTRACTION DOWN BY 28%\nWhen taking a mass perspective, clearly the most \nimpactful interventions for closing the Circularity Gap \ncome from Housing , but also Nutrition . Although \nit is a less impactful spatial need, Consumables ’ \nintervention ‘Eliminate toxins and pollutants’ scored \nan interesting contribution to the Circularity Gap. \nIn general, for Consumables , it seems that the only \nproduct category that can have sizable impacts on \nemissions and circularity is related to the use of \nchemicals and chemical products.\nThe mitigation potential for Housing  largely stems \nfrom the diversion of C&DW. Of all global waste in \n2016, a massive 67.6% came from stocks: largely \ndemolished buildings, infrastructure (and machinery, \nequipment and vehicles to a smaller extent). With the \nglobal average recovery rates of C&DW only standing \nat 35%, there is huge potential for impact here. As \na result, fewer virgin materials would need to be \nextracted, which would alleviate the environmental \nimpacts of mining and processing to produce materials \nsuch as cement and steel for construction. A further \nbenefit would be that the amount of cycled materials in \nthe economy would rise.\nHowever there are limitations to how much we can \nclose the Gap—primarily due to the non-synergistic \nrelationship between some interventions. Some \nthat focus on designing products and infrastructure \nto last means that stocks last longer, resulting in a \nfurther locking up of materials, which diminishes their \npotential for cycling. In the case of durable housing, \nthis has a huge impact on the Circularity Gap, given the \nlarge critical mass of construction materials. We found \na similar pattern for Consumables  and Mobility : while \ndurability interventions that extend product lifetime \ncan slash material use by 2.5 billion tonnes, they also \nreduce the cycling potential of these goods, appearing \nless ‘circular’ in our assessment than they actually \nwould be in reality. This doesn’t negate the relevance \n43\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n42\n\n\nTRANSITION\nTAIL-\nORED\nPATH-\nWAYS\n6\n2021 will be the year that many countries revise \ntheir NDCs. This report has now shown the massive \npotential of circular strategies to deliver at a \nglobal level. However, to influence the massive \ndecisions that will impact our climate future for \ngenerations to come and see real-life results, \nthe global roadmap must be tailored to national \npathways. This chapter builds on the country \nprofiles introduced in the Circularity Gap Report \n2020 ; whilst recognising that no single country \ncan ever be a perfect match for all the criteria of \nany one group, it is important to join the dots of \nour understanding. In this chapter, we consider \nthe high-impact areas of Nutrition, Housing \nand Mobility, plus the enabling role of waste \nmanagement in three distinct country profiles—so \ndemonstrating the nuances of implementing our \nroadmap for a well below 2-degree world,  \nin practice. \nDIFFERENT COUNTRIES, COMMON NEEDS\nDespite clear divergences between countries, we can \nstill discern which circular economy interventions will \nbe most suitable in certain contexts based on clear \ncommon needs and structural parallels. In our 2020 \nanalysis, we took 176 countries and scored them \non their social performance 60 and their ecological \nfootprint 61 to assess how far they were from the end \ngoal: a socially just and ecologically safe space. Our \noverarching finding was illuminating: no country \nresides within a safe and just space today. Some \ncountries are close, others are far away; each starts \nfrom a different point on the map, but all have a \ndistance to go. The position of each country in this \nanalysis helps us form the three broad country \nprofiles, which may exhibit some overlaps but overall \nallow us to highlight key common themes that are \ncentral to development pathways.\nA key point here is severe carbon inequality at present \nand how it has driven our world into the midst of a \nclimate emergency. Nearly half (48%) of cumulative \nCO2 emissions over the last quarter century can be \nattributed to just the richest 10% of the globe, whilst \nthe poorest 50% were responsible for only 7%. 62 In \nthe past decades, our tight global carbon budget has \nbeen lavished on feeding the consumption of the rich \nwhile failing to lift the majority of the global population \nout of poverty. And in a cruel irony, the emissions \ninequality also has another side: lower-income nations \nwho contribute the fewest emissions are also most \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate breakdown. 63 \nThe 2000s have seen a record number of natural \ndisasters, rising sea levels and extreme weather \nevents—all of which are connected to climate change \nand disproportionately impact lower-income nations. 64\nAside from the statistics presented in the table on page \n49, which clearly illustrates the physical, social and \neconomic dimensions of the country profiles, it’s also \nworth considering the emissions and material footprint \nof each profile. This helps us tailor their diagnoses and \nprovide insights into how different country profiles can \nreduce the material and emissions footprint of their \nNutrition, Housing, Mobility and waste management \nneeds. It is clear that leveraging the climate change \nmitigation potential of a circular economy in Build \ncountries means something different from doing so  \nin a Grow or a Shift country. \nCountry profile roadmaps\nPhoto by Tembela Bohle \n45\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n\nSHIFTGROWBUILD\nMATERIAL FOOTPRINT (G t )\nCARBON FOOTPRINT CO 2 eq (G t )\nMOBILITY\n-2.2\n-2.6\n-2.2\n-2.2\n-0.5\n-0.6\nCONSUMABLES\n-1.6\n-0.8\n-1.6\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\nHOUSING\n-4.2\n-4.2\n-7.1\n-5.5\n-1.4\n-1.4\nHEALTHCARE\n-0.1\n-0.09\n-0.1\n-0.1\n-0.03\n-0.02\nCOMMUNICATION\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.03\n-0.01\nNUTRITION\n-2.3\n-2.2\n-0.9\n-0.5-1.5\n-1\nSHIFTGROWBUILD\nMATERIAL FOOTPRINT (G t )\nCARBON FOOTPRINT CO 2 eq (G t )\nMOBILITY\n-2.2\n-2.6\n-2.2\n-2.2\n-0.5\n-0.6\nCONSUMABLES\n-1.6\n-0.8\n-1.6\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\nHOUSING\n-4.2\n-4.2\n-7.1\n-5.5\n-1.4\n-1.4\nHEALTHCARE\n-0.1\n-0.09\n-0.1\n-0.1\n-0.03\n-0.02\nCOMMUNICATION\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.03\n-0.01\nNUTRITION\n-2.3\n-2.2\n-0.9\n-0.5-1.5\n-1\nSHIFTGROWBUILD\nMATERIAL FOOTPRINT (G t )\nCARBON FOOTPRINT CO 2 eq (G t )\nMOBILITY\n-2.2\n-2.6\n-2.2\n-2.2\n-0.5\n-0.6\nCONSUMABLES\n-1.6\n-0.8\n-1.6\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\nHOUSING\n-4.2\n-4.2\n-7.1\n-5.5\n-1.4\n-1.4\nHEALTHCARE\n-0.1\n-0.09\n-0.1\n-0.1\n-0.03\n-0.02\nCOMMUNICATION\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.03\n-0.01\nNUTRITION\n-2.3\n-2.2\n-0.9\n-0.5-1.5\n-1\nSHIFTGROWBUILD\nMATERIAL FOOTPRINT (G t )\nCARBON FOOTPRINT CO 2 eq (G t )\nMOBILITY\n-2.2\n-2.6\n-2.2\n-2.2\n-0.5\n-0.6\nCONSUMABLES\n-1.6\n-0.8\n-1.6\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\nHOUSING\n-4.2\n-4.2\n-7.1\n-5.5\n-1.4\n-1.4\nHEALTHCARE\n-0.1\n-0.09\n-0.1\n-0.1\n-0.03\n-0.02\nCOMMUNICATION\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.1\n-0.08\n-0.03\n-0.01\nNUTRITION\n-2.3\n-2.2\n-0.9\n-0.5-1.5\n-1\nCOUNTRY PROFILES\nREDUCING EMMISSIONS\n& RESOURCE USE\nFigure Five shows which of our interventions have the most impact \non the emissions and material footprint in absolute terms of each \ncountry profiles. All figures are in negative billion tonnes (Gt).\nBUILD\nA low rate of material consumption per capita means \nBuild countries currently transgress few planetary \nboundaries, if any at all. They are responsible for the \nproduction of just 17% of global emissions and 19% \nof global resources in absolute terms, despite making \nup 48% of the global population. But these countries \nare struggling to meet their basic needs, including \nHuman Development Index (HDI) indicators such as \neducation and healthcare. They have biomass-oriented \neconomies and are resource-rich, yet are net importers \nof fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals  \nin the form of finished and semi-finished products.  \nAs they continue to build their more basic \ninfrastructure, Build countries have a uniqueposition \nin moving toward closing both the Circularity and \nEmissions Gaps. \nWhen assessing the potential of Chapter Four’s \ninterventions, Figure Five shows that Housing and \nNutrition have the largest impact in Build countries. As \nBuild countries blaze ahead on improving the quality \nof life for their populations, four pathways in particular \ncan aid the transition to a circular future that can also \nsupport limiting warming to well below 2-degrees. \nThese relate to reforming agricultural practices away \nfrom monocropping and deforestation, applying \ncircular thinking across their necessary construction, \nensuring infrastructure for distributed and accessible \nmobility solutions in growing cities and combining \ninformal and formal waste management infrastructure. \nThe Build profile is most relevant to countries \nin Sub-Saharan Africa, plus some small \nisland states and Asian countries. The larger \ncountries by population to which the profile \nmay apply are India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, \nNigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines. \n47\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n46\n\n\nSHIFT\nAs leading emitters across all resource categories, Shift \ncountries are at the centre of the transition towards \na circular, low-carbon economy. Despite hosting a \nminority of the global population, they produce the \nmajority of emissions (43%) and account for one-third \n(31%) of all global resource extraction. Their material \nconsumption is 10 times greater than Build countries. \nPer capita, Shift countries are the largest consumers \nacross all resource groups; their extraction of fossil \nfuels is relatively high, as is their participation in global \ntrade. So, despite high HDI scores and comfortable \nlifestyles, these countries have a way to go to limit \ntheir consumption in line with our planet’s resources. \nFigure Five  guides us in narrowing our focus for impact, \nand demonstrates how high impact Shift countries \nare. They are also highly responsible for reducing \nglobal emissions, particularly from an historical \nperspective, and are under pressure to do so—fast. \nIn the high-impact areas of Nutrition, Mobility and \nHousing, Shift countries need to, first and foremost, \ntake responsibility and reduce their consumption \nby integrating circular strategies across the board: \nfrom ownership to sharing models; to making the \nmost of their goods—from buildings to vehicles—\nbefore, during and after their functional lifetimes \nand optimising how waste is valorised in the already \nmature waste management systems. To get there,  \nthey must mobilise all the technologies and funds  \nthat they have at their disposal. \nThe Shift profile fits best with the  \nhigher-income countries in the global North, \nin the Middle East and on the Australian \ncontinent. The larger ones are the United \nStates of America, Japan, Argentina and \nmember countries of the European Union.\nThe Grow profile is most relevant to countries \nin Latin America and Northern Africa, as well as \nthose with an economy in transition in Eastern \nEurope, the Caucasus and Central Asia, plus \nlarger Asian countries. The largest countries in \nthis group are China, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, \nVietnam and Egypt.\nGROW\nGrow countries are manufacturing hubs, hosting \nan expanding industrial sector and leading the way \nwhen it comes to building and economic growth. \nIn facilitating rapid infrastructure expansion to lift \na vast proportion of the population out of poverty \nand to accommodate a growing middle-class, they \nclaim 47% of global emissions and 51% of global \nresource extraction from a consumption perspective, \nin absolute terms. They have the highest rate of \nnon-metallic mineral extraction at 68%, are heavy \nmetal ore users and are net-exporters of all four \nresource groups—they are the ‘resource banks’ of the \nglobal economy. The rapid industrialisation of these \ncountries, and the expansion of the middle class, has \noccurred concurrently with improving living standards. \nFigure Five highlights which societal needs require  \nthe heftiest emissions and material footprints, and \nguides us in narrowing our focus for impact.  \nFour key transition arenas arise: prioritising \nsustainable agriculture, especially in products set for \nexport, mainstreaming resource-efficient and low-\ncarbon construction materials, satiating the growing \nappetite for energy with renewable sources where \npossible and establishing infrastructure for effective \nmaterial cycling, including construction and  \ndemolition waste (C&DW). \nCOUNTRY PROFILES: PHYSICAL, SOCIAL \n& ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS\n \nDEMOGRAPHIC  \nINDICATORS\nPopulation 65 7.46 billion people for all countries in each profile\nEmployment in \nagriculture 66 21 percentage of total employment\nECONOMIC  \nINDICATORS\nGross domestic \nProduct 67 60.3 trillion € (Constant 2010) for all countries in each profile\nTrade volume 68 33.7\ntrillion € (Constant 2010) aggregate imports and exports \nfor all countries in each profile\nENERGY INDICATORS\nElectricity access 69 89 percentage of population with access to electricity\nEnergy usage 70 13.1 billion tonnes of oil equivalent used per year\nRenewable energy \nconsumption 71 19.1\npercentage of renewable energy consumption based on \noverall energy consumption*\nMATERIAL INDICATORS\nMaterial footprint 72 92.1\nbillion tonnes of materials used by all countries in each \nprofile\nMaterial footprint per \ncapita 73 12.3 tonnes of materials used per capita per year\nMaterial footprint of \nimports per capita 74 1.8\ntonnes of materials embodied in imports of all countries \nin each profile\nMaterial footprint of \nexports per capita 75 1.8\ntonnes of materials embodied in exports of all countries \nin each profile\nStock build-up 76 28.7\nbillion tonnes of non-metallic minerals used in all \ncountries in each profile*\nWaste generation 77 25.1\nbillion tonnes of waste generated per year for all \ncountries in each profile (excluding mining waste)\nCARBON FOOTPRINT \nINDICATORS\nCarbon footprint 78 50.5\nbillion tonnes of CO 2 equivalents for all countries in the \nprofile (excluding LULUCF)\nCarbon footprint  \nper Capita 79 6.76\ntonnes of CO 2 equivalents per capita for all countries in \nthe profile (excluding LULUCF)\nCarbon footprint of \nimports per capita 80 0.62\ntonnes of CO 2 equivalents per capita embodied in \nimports of all countries in each profile\nCarbon footprint of \nexports per capita 81 0.62 tonnes of CO 2 equivalents per capita embodied in \nexports of all countries in each profile\nBUILD GROW SHIFT\nWORLD\n49\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n48\n\n\nThe circular economy assumes dynamic systems,  \na process of transformation rather than a specific  \nend-point.

How we grow, source, process \nand transport our food—and what type of foods we \neat—has a massive impact on both global emissions \nand material use. As agricultural production volumes \nrise and animal farming becomes more prevalent, \nland-use change (LUC) considerations in Build and \nGrow countries come to the fore. This is also due to the \nposition of Grow countries as the largest agricultural \nproducers in the world for virtually all commodities, 82 \nwith almost one-quarter of the population employed \nin agriculture. Animal protein-intensive diets in Shift \ncountries particularly affect agricultural emissions \nascribed to Grow countries, with over 16% of the \ncarbon footprint of the average EU diet attributable to \ndeforestation. 83 As disposable incomes rise across the \nglobe, the pressure to safeguard our earth’s natural \ncarbon sinks —forests—from deforestation in Build and \nGrow countries mounts, as well as moving toward more \nregenerative agricultural practices . Meanwhile, Shift \ncountries should look at reducing the impact of their \noften carbon-intensive diets —from animal products \nto out-of-season products shipped around the globe \nabroad—and high levels of food waste .\nTo create a circular and low-carbon approach \nto agriculture, flows could first and foremost be \nnarrowed  in all country profiles, characterised by an \nefficient use of agricultural land. Across the board, \nthe use of artificial fertilisers, pesticides and other \npollutants should be eliminated to the extent possible \nto maintain healthy, fertile soils and safeguard \nbiodiversity. Implementing a fully-fledged circular \nmodel of regenerative agriculture can drive the desired \noutcomes, whereby animal husbandry is balanced \nwith crop cultivation, allowing waste products to be \ncycled  into inputs: manure becomes fertiliser and crop \ntrimmings and waste become fodder. In Build and Grow \ncountries, resource-efficient practices that combine \nagriculture, forestry and livestock in community-\nmanaged systems are particularly relevant. In addition, \nefforts should be made in all country profiles to \neliminate soil-degrading monocropping. \nRising levels of deforestation in Build and Grow \ncountries—driven by practices such as feed-crop \ncultivation, expansion of pasture land and the planting \nof monocultures, to name a few—should be brought \nto a standstill. This can be done through a mixture of \nlegislative action and rethinking the business model . \nIn fact, research suggests that promoting a market for \nsustainably and responsibly produced goods in Shift \ncountries, may, ultimately, be more effective than policy \naction. 84 This idea is strongly linked to the need for Shift \ncountries to drastically reduce their consumption of \nanimal products, which will have a sizable impact on \nboth deforestation and other environmental indicators. \nShift countries should also focus on narrowing  flows \nby preventing the waste of edible food along the value \nchain. Innovative business models that incorporate \ndigital technology  can help prevent food waste \nat retail and household stages—which amounts to \napproximately 88 million tonnes per year in the EU, or \n173 kilograms per person per year. 85 In Build and Grow \ncountries, preventing losses at farm-stage, rather than \nhousehold stage, is the primary challenge. In Brazil, \nfor example, logistical issues hinder sufficient food \nstorage—resulting in post-harvest losses of a mammoth \n45%.86 Losses can be mitigated with improved storage \ntechnology and infrastructure. On a global scale, food \nloss and waste are responsible for about 8% of GHG \nemissions 87—and all countries have a role to play in \nminimising this figure. \nREGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE: \nBRINGING LIFE BACK TO LAND\nNiger, a country that historically battled \ndesertification, has substantially \nincreased its tree cover by transferring \nthe ownership rights of trees from the \ngovernment—which gave farmers little \nincentive to grow or protect them—to \nthe people. In doing so, farmers can \nmake money from their trees by selling \nbranches, fruit and bark—a more lucrative \nopportunity than felling the trees for \nfirewood. The result has been a surge in \ncommunity-managed forestry systems , \nwith the environmental co-benefits of \nhealthier, more fertile and less dry soil. 88 89 \nIn Brazil, systems-thinking has influenced \nthe Balbo Group to practice regenerative \nagriculture at scale—emulating natural \nprocesses and turning ‘waste’ into a \nresource. 90 The group developed a novel \nsystem for harvesting green cane: a \nmachine splits cane into pieces, feeds the \npieces into a hopper, strips the leaves, \nand returns the matter to the soil. While \nprevious methods involved burning \nsugarcane straw pre-harvest, Balbo’s \nEcosystem Revitalisation Agriculture \n(ERA) feeds 20 tonnes of organic material \nper hectare back into the soil, forming \na mulch that replenishes nutrients, \nlocks in moisture and hinders weed \ngrowth . Along with reduced pesticide \nand fertiliser use, the system provides \n20% higher yields than conventional \nsugarcane production. Across nations, \nCommonland is doing similar work. The \ninitiative’s drylands work in the water-\nscarce region of Altiplano Estepario \nregion, Spain, tackles desertification \nand erosion. 91 Project members planted \n50,000 drought-resistant trees  native \nto the region, implemented measures to \nimprove soil water retention, promoted \nbiodiversity and engaged and mobilised \nlocal farmers and community members.\n51\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n50\n\n\nDESIGN CIRCULARITY \nINTO STOCKS\nWhen it comes to the construction sector, the three \ncountry profiles are worlds apart. Build countries have \nthe unique position where much of their infrastructure \ndevelopment has yet to happen. In stark contrast, in \nthe Grow country of China, for example, more concrete \nwas used in the past three years alone than the US in \nthe entire 20th century. 82 Finally, the fact that Build \nand Grow countries are in the midst of building up \ncrucial stock and infrastructure, while Shift countries \nshould in theory have this available already, further \naggravates the severe difference in consumption \nlevels. We need to make strides in this hard-to-\nabate industry: by designing circularity into new \nconstruction projects  in Build countries and ensuring \nthat it also takes centre stage in infrastructure to \naccommodate Grow’s swiftly growing middle-class—by \nmeans of lightweighting and cycling —we can yield \nsignificant reductions in their emissions and material \nfootprints. Policy in Shift countries should limit \nstock expansion , require the reuse of construction \nmaterials and extend the functional lifetime of \nbuildings and infrastructure  to stem the impact of \none of the globe’s most polluting sectors. \nThe accelerating demand of urbanisation in Build and \nGrow countries necessitates new stock build-up—this \nis evident already. Looking ahead, the opportunity \nexists to narrow  flows by designing for the future , \nand using locally-procured, lightweight materials (like \nwood, clay and loam) to replace emissions-intensive, \ntraditionally linear alternatives such as cement, \nsteel and glass. 93 94 95 96  Advances in architectural and \nengineering applications for regenerative  wooden \nmaterials allow for broader use of locally-sourced and \nrenewable timber, even in high-rise buildings. In Build \ncountries, passive design and durable, climate-resilient \ndesign emerge as priorities. In the case that cement \nuse is absolutely necessary, both Build and Grow \ncountry profiles could slash emissions by replacing \ncarbon-intensive clinker with biological residuals like \nrice husk. An innovative production chain in Brazil, for \nexample, uses açaí pits as a clinker substitute, both \nimproving the sustainability of the energy matrix and \nproviding local jobs in the process. 97 98 \nIn Shift countries, where stock buildup is at a \nrelatively steady level, the focus should be placed on \nmaking the most of what already exists in the built \nenvironment—ultimately slowing  flows to extend the \nfunctional lifetime of buildings through renovation \nrather than demolition. Flows can be narrowed by \nreducing the overall floorspace populations need, and \nby using space more efficiently: in the wake of covid-19, \nwe have seen a decreased need for office space as \nthe professional workforce have been confined to \ntheir homes, raising support for flexible location \nworking and partial home-office arrangements post-\npandemic. This opens up traditional office spaces to be \nretrofitted for a myriad of functions, from housing to \ncommunity space—a practice that should be echoed \nin future design which can incorporate the principles \nof ‘flex buildings’. In the case that new construction \nis necessary, Shift countries should anticipate the \ncycling and regenerating of flows for instance by \nleveraging the urban mine. Modular design and offsite \nconstruction, which can avoid glueing of components, \nboth enable swift disassembly and reassembly of \nmodules, extending the functional lifetime of parts. \nCombined with digital technology such as materials \npassports, 99 which catalogue the products used in \na building and create documented ‘storage units’ of \nmaterials, Shift countries will have an arsenal of tactics \nto make the most of their buildings before, during and \nafter their functional lifetimes.\nMAKE  MOBILITY \nCLEAN\nMobility remains a dominant emitter, especially in \nShift countries where commuting and global travel \nare frequent and car ownership is ubiquitous. But \nBuild countries will see a greater need for passenger \nmobility and freight systems as their cities grow \nrapidly—often with limited urban planning or \ncoordination. In Grow countries, meanwhile, meteoric \nurbanisation has already occurred and mobility \nsystems are under immense strain. The need for \nefficient and sustainable passenger and freight \nmobility  echoes across the profiles. But demand must \nnot be fed with traditional mobility solutions based \non fossil fuel combustion. Instead, urban planning  \nwhich encourages fossil-free mobility and incorporates \nmodern and digital technologies  to regenerate  \nflows should take centre stage. Shifting business \nmodels and behaviour from ownership to sharing  \nand incorporating durable design into vehicles also \nemerge as impactful avenues—especially for Shift \ncountries where the average European car is parked \nfor 92% of the time. 104\nFortunately, circular strategies can pave the way \ntowards sustainable urban mobility. Firstly, all county \nprofiles are able to narrow  carbon and resource \nfootprints by curbing the need for transportation. In \nGrow and Build countries, the rapid expansion of cities \noften coincides with the challenge of creating effective, \nwell-distributed transportation networks. The UN \nestimates that by 2030, 43 ‘mega-cities’ with upwards \nof 10 million inhabitants will span the globe—the \nmajority located in Grow countries. Meanwhile, many \nurbanised Shift cities are now already busy with urban \nplanning initiatives to encourage the de-motorisation \nof transport. Rethinking the business model  and \nincorporating urban planning could create  \nwell-coordinated ‘community villages’, or \nneighbourhoods, where residents can easily \nsatisfy their daily needs—school, work, retail and \nentertainment—by foot, or on bike. This, in turn, \nreduces traffic, congestion and consequential air \npollution. Cities across all profiles may also work \nto reduce emissions by targeting freight mobility. \nInterventions like the creation of ‘pick up points’—\ncollection and distribution depots scattered \nthroughout neighbourhoods—reduce the journeys \ndelivery companies have to make, thereby reducing \ntraffic congestion and emissions. 105 \nBIO-MATERIALS: THE HOLY GRAIL \nOF CIRCULAR CONSTRUCTION\nInnovations in bio-based construction \nmaterials have impacted lives and \nhousing developments in Kenya, where \nresearch team Pamoja Projects has \ndeveloped a material sheet  made of \nresidual waste from corn and rice \ncrops. The technology is both low-cost \nand sustainable, and can be locally \nprocured for use in construction projects \nacross the continent—also boosting \njob creation in rural areas which \nprevents mass migration to urban areas \nunequipped to handle a population \nboom.100 Build countries may continue \nto develop housing and infrastructure \nwith circular strategies in mind—going \nbeyond a sole focus on materials and \nadditionally encompassing social \nwellbeing. Tsoga Environmental Centre, a \ncommunity centre in one of Cape Town’s \ninformal settlements, encapsulates \nthese principles: the project was shaped \nto upskill and employ residents , use \nlocally procured and sustainable \nmaterials  and improve quality of life \nfor the neighborhood’s residents. 101 \nBamboo—which is fast growing and \nprevalent in tropical and subtropical \nregions—is another opportunity for \nbuilding circularity into stocks. The \nPanyaden International School in \nChiang Mai, Thailand, exemplifies the \nbenefits of this beautiful and sustainable \nmaterial: the school commissioned a 782 \nsquare metre sports hall, built from \nbamboo without steel reinforcements \nor connections. The design meets \nmodern safety standards while allowing \nfor natural ventilation, and is entirely \ncarbon-neutral: the CO 2 sequestered by \nthe bamboo during growth was greater \nthan emissions from transportation \nand construction. 102 In Shift countries, \nsimilar advances are being made in the \ndevelopment of novel building materials: \nfor example, the innovative use of \nseaweed  in Danish architecture provides \na material that is naturally rot and fire \nresistant, carbon negative  and repels \npests due to its high salt content. The \nseaweed is used in building panels that \ncan be easily prefabricated—and then \ndisassembled at end-of-life—and acts \nas a natural temperature regulator that \nreduces the need for excessive heating \nand cooling. 103\n53\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n52\n\n\nUrban planners can also implement polycentric \ndesign, where several key districts can coexist and \nfunction as a self-contained ‘city within a city,’ thereby \nshortening commuting distances and increasing public \ntransport use between the sub-centres. 106 Meanwhile, \nparticularly in Shift countries, locked-down nations \nreduced their travel immensely in 2020 as many office-\nbased professionals used digital technologies  to \nmove to online environments—proving that many of us \ndon’t need to commute every day. \nWhile fewer opportunities exist to regenerate  and \nelectrify car transport in Build and Grow countries, \nowing to lower levels of vehicle ownership and less \nexpansive charging infrastructure, they can still \nmake a huge impact by electrifying their scooter \nfleet and public forms of transport. Although some \nShift countries, such as Norway, boast an impressive \nnumber of electric vehicles, additional solutions \nsuch as sustainably generated hydrogen or biofuels \nrepresent interesting avenues for further innovation in \ncombustion engines. It’s not only the fuel for vehicles \nthat makes Mobility in Shift countries very resource \nand emission-intensive, though. Firstly, a large amount \nof materials are funnelled into building transport \ntechnologies such as cars, trains, or ships in the first \nplace. Also, vehicle ownership is very high; electric \nor not. Therefore, Shift countries should investigate \nthe classic slowing  strategy that is especially suited \nto countries that already have a substantial fleet \nof vehicles: rethinking the business model  and \nencouraging car-sharing over ownership.\nTHE NEW MOBILITY: URBAN \nCONNECTIVITY, ELECTRIFICATION \nAND SHARING SYSTEMS\nActions to stimulate a modal shift are \nalready occurring across Build countries, \nfrom the introduction of high-speed \nelectric trains  connecting cities in India, 107 \nto the revitalisation of colonial-era rail \nsystems across Africa. 108 Currently, Africa’s \ntransportation capacity is fairly limited \nto road transport, with up to 90% of \npeople moving from A to B with motorised \nvehicles, resulting in severe congestion in \nurban centres. Revamping rail systems  \nwill finally reconnect secondary cities \nto nationwide networks—presenting a \ncrucial opportunity for both emissions \nreduction and improved urban planning. \nThe importance of urban planning \nin inspiring modal shifts is clear: in \nMyanmar, for example, the past decades \nof urbanisation saw the development \nof wide-laned rural roads in urban \ncentres , with no transitional public \nspace and often susceptible to flooding. \nChanges in planning policy began to \naccommodate cyclists and pedestrians  \nthrough narrowing lanes, eventually \nresulting in measurable reductions in \nemissions and air pollution. 109 Meanwhile, \ncircular mobility in Grow countries can \ntake the form of electrification and sharing \nsystems. As scooters are the predominant \nform of transport in many countries \nacross this profile, sharing systems for \nelectric scooters  are on the rise across \nBrazil, China, Malaysia, Mexico and South \nAfrica,110 allowing for more individualised \nmobility. In Shift countries, car sharing \nis enjoying a spike in success—especially \nas companies like Zipcar spread across \nthe globe, establishing roots in over 500 \ncities. With the tagline ‘Own the trip, not \nthe car’ the company works to change \nestablished attitudes about ownership  \nby providing the convenience of car use \nwithout the hassleshassles of maintenance \nand repair.111\nPhoto by Vishal Shah\n55\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n54\n\n\nIMPROVE  WASTE \nMANAGEMENT\nIncreasing affluence in Build and Grow countries—\nespecially the swelling middle class in the latter—will \nsee a concurrent increase in waste, not yet matched \nby sufficient waste management infrastructure. \nWaste management is a crucial enabler of the circular \neconomy, as recovering materials or energy from \nwaste is necessary to close loops and provides a \ncontinuous stream of resources. In the absence \nof waste management systems, or when they are \noverloaded with other countries’ waste, unregulated \nopen-fire burning—which emits black carbon and \nharmful toxins—has become an issue of mounting \nurgency for both environmental and human health.  \nIt is estimated that over 40% of the globe’s solid waste \nis burned in open fires, with a significantly higher \nproportion in lower-income countries. 112 Without \nsufficient infrastructure to collect, sort and process \nwaste, this rate is only set to increase. Linked to this \nissue is the rate of waste Shift countries export out \nto other countries, where there can be insufficient \nvalorisation of waste materials . While waste \ninfrastructure in Shift countries often runs smoothly, \nmuch work is yet to be done to fully close material \nloops and make the most of what we consider waste .\nWaste management priorities vary widely between \ncountry profiles. In many cases, kerbside waste \ncollection in Build countries is limited, and rarely \nreaches large unregistered settlements on the \nperiphery of dense urban zones. In these areas, \nwaste collection is largely organised and conducted \nthrough informal workers, also prevalent in some Grow \ncountries, who can face significant social and health \nchallenges in the absence of formalised unions. This \ndemonstrates a need to rethink the business model , \nbeginning with the empowerment, formalisation \nand eventual upskilling of waste pickers—before \nattempting to build up recycling or incineration plants. \nBuild and Grow countries can endeavour to future \nwaste flows by limiting the amount of waste produced \nin the first place—for example, through bans on \nsingle-use items, or measures to address the sachet \neconomy prevalent in lower-income communities. \nOnce sufficient infrastructure has been built for \nprocessing and segregating waste, flows can be cycled  \nby finding alternative end-points for waste—such as \nthe transformation of organic waste into biogas.  \nIdeal avenues for cycling  in Grow countries may \ninclude industrial symbiosis approaches, where closely \nlocated industrial activities utilise each other’s waste \nstreams. \nShift countries produce the highest levels of \nwaste—11.6 billion tonnes per annum for all countries \nin the profile. As levels of collection and processing \nare relatively high, the priority here becomes reducing \noverall waste volumes. Countries can design for \nthe future , eliminating excess resource use in \npackaging and product design, and prioritise the \nuse of regenerative resources , for example by using \nbiodegradable materials for packaging or certain \nproduct components. In managing the waste volumes \nthat still arise, Shift countries must stop exporting \ntheir recyclable waste to Build and Grow countries, \nwhere processing facilities lack capacity. Policymakers \nand governments can also team up to create value  \nand further roll-out schemes like Extended Producer \nResponsibility to hold corporations accountable for \ntheir waste. As technology is developed to process \ncurrently non-recyclable waste, landfills should be \neliminated, with a view to remediating affected areas \nand restoring degraded ecosystems.\nRAMPING UP RECYCLING: WASTE \nPICKERS, REUSE SOLUTIONS AND \nDIGITAL TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology-based solutions come into play \nin unifying the informal sector, as seen \nin the case of Kabadiwalla Connect. The \nIndian company provides cost-effective \nand low-carbon solutions for waste \ncollection, segregation and processing  \nthrough spatial mapping, digitalisation, \nsourcing and reverse logistics solutions \nthat integrate informal workers into \nthe system. For non-recyclable waste, \nother solutions emerge: community \nmembers can create ‘eco-bricks’ to use in \nconstruction, using waste as a resource  \nby stuffing plastic bottles with non-\nrecyclable waste, which are then used to \nform interlocking blocks. Port Elizabeth, \nSouth Africa, will boast the world’s largest \neco brick building: a school built entirely \nof the material, spearheaded by non-\nprofit EcoBrick Exchange. 113 It should be \nnoted that higher-value applications or \nrecycling are preferable on the waste \nmanagement hierarchy—but nonetheless, \nthe project has already removed over 10 \ntonnes of waste from the community. \nProjects that increase accurate sorting, \na crucial component of high-quality \nrecycling, are also on the rise—as \nexemplified by UK-based pioneer project \nHolyGrail. The startup’s approach is to \ntag recyclables with codes unique to their \ncomposition, using chemical tracers and \ndigital watermarks. Preliminary results \nare promising, demonstrating that digital \nwatermark technology  can be applied in \na myriad of situations and retrofitted into \nexisting waste facilities—thus allowing for \nimproved sorting rates, and consequently, \nhigher levels of plastic recycling. \n57\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n56\n\n\nNATIONAL\nCLIMATE\nAND THE\nPLEDGES\nNDC s\n7\nEnabling a global circular economy\nThe rescheduling of 2020’s COP26 and the  \nfar-reaching impact of covid-19 means that most \ncountries were not on track to update their \nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by the \nend of 2020. This allows us to shape climate pledges \nfor the globe guided by the lessons we have learnt \nover the last year. We live in a world that is only \n8.6% circular and nowhere near limiting warming \nto below 2-degrees. This report can guide countries \nin making the course-correction we so desperately \nneed: for the economy, ecology and society. This \nchapter details the barriers and enabling factors \nfor a circular roadmap in the Build, Grow and Shift \nprofiles, as well as assessing the efficacy of their \ncurrent climate pledges: the NDCs. Across the \nboard, current NDCs are overwhelmingly focused \non the energy transition. Circular nations are  \nnot only more resource-efficient and low carbon, \nbut there are many co-benefits to be enjoyed.  \nFor countries, this truly is their time. \nENABLING THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION IN \nBUILD COUNTRIES\nBuild countries have a number of contextual \nfactors to consider in creating an enabling \nenvironment for the successful uptake of circular \nstrategies. They are resource-rich and place a high \nfocus on the extraction and sale of raw materials, \nbut fall short in HDI indicators like education \nand healthcare. The good news: they have yet to \nbuild up much of their infrastructure, presenting \na key opportunity to embed circularity in their \npractices and NDC pledges surrounding biomass, \nconstruction, mobility and waste management.  \nWhen it comes to legislation and policy, in Build \ncountries, teaming up to create joint value is crucial in \nbetter-enforcing laws and in requiring multinationals—\noften from Shift countries—to take charge of their \nvalue-chain impacts across the world. While tackling \ndeforestation is imperative, and often well-addressed \nin Build NDCs, the reality is politically fraught 114 115 \n116 117 —and well-articulated laws are often broken, 118 \nresulting in half of all tropical deforestation  \nhappening illegally. 104 \nSimilarly, lax regulations have allowed for the growth \nof unplanned urban ‘sprawl’ around the periphery of \nBuild cities—whilst this housing is urgently needed, \nit must be sufficiently planned for—, 120 hindering the \nimplementation of distributed mobility systems and \nefficient waste collection. The implementation of \nenvironmental regulation and planning can be stifled \nwith structural enforcement issues and corruption; \ntherefore, addressing these obstacles through \nincreased transparency and control is imperative \nto facilitating sustainable growth and protection of \nnatural capital in Build countries.\nBuild countries are also often characterised by a high \nprevalence of informal workers: in Africa, as much \nas 86% of the population is employed in the informal \nsector.121 Teaming up to create joint value and aligning \nthe role of the decentralised labour sector with waste \nmanagement processes will be necessary to reduce \nfootprints and material use from both construction \nand demolition waste (C&DW) and solid municipal \nwaste. Burning—which can occur at major landfills, \nsmall dumpsites or households—may be spurred \nby a desire to uncover non-flammable materials \nlike metals for scavenging. By introducing waste \nmanagement infrastructure, halting waste-imports \nfrom Shift countries and formalising waste pickers—\nallowing them to work in safer conditions in processing \nfacilities—these issues may be addressed. \nFinally, actions taken across Build countries must be \nholistic in nature, and consider the complexities of the \nissues at hand. Previous efforts to address the waste \nproblem, for example, have seen donors pouring \nfinancial resources into one big project, as results are \neasier to monitor. 122 Such projects may lack qualities \nnecessary for and specific to localities, and because \nthey do not take the wider context into consideration, \noften go out of business or lack economic viability. 123 \nWell-intentioned but misguided policies can backfire \nwithout a long-term approach and consideration of \nknock-on effects. The need for holistic action plans  \nand participatory approaches—that consider the \npeople these measures will affect—applies across \nsectors and geographies. \nPRIORITIES FOR BUILD COUNTRIES’ NDCS\nDespite the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change’s recognition of ‘common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities’, which acknowledges the \ncomparatively minimal contribution of Build countries \nto climate breakdown, these countries’ NDCs showcase \nstrong ambitions and detailed action plans for climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation. Their contributions, \nat times, detail the importance of shifting attitudes and \nhabits as well as honing in on technology and finance. \nPhoto by Luiz Clas \n59\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n\nIndia, for example, pledges to ‘propagate a healthy \nand sustainable way of living based on traditions and \nvalues of conservation and moderation’, and notes \nthat we ‘must promote...sustainable lifestyles across \nthe globe’.124 Although it varies by country, circular \nstrategies pop up within Build NDCs, especially in the \nrealms of agriculture, forestry, energy efficiency and \nrenewables expansion. In Ethiopia’s NDC, for instance, \nagriculture and forestry are prioritised as they have \nthe greatest emissions mitigation potential, while \nKenya focuses on continuing to grow their already \nmostly clean energy mix by enhancing solar, wind and \ngeothermal development. While these countries are \ngenerally on track regarding circularity and mitigation \nefforts, often with a strong additional focus on building \nresilience, there is room for growth. \nMoving forward, Build countries can place a greater \nemphasis on developing circular construction and \nmobility systems, facilitated by cutting-edge urban \nplanning and powered by renewables. Further \nchallenges may arise in the implementation of the \ntransition pathways already well-aligned with country \nNDCs; as corruption and political instability prevail, \neffective policy-making is vulnerable to manipulation \nfrom special interest groups. 125 For Build countries \nto successfully close both Gaps, well-intentioned \nlegislation must be backed by strong political will and \nenforcement, and global markets must adapt to create \nroom for sustainably produced goods and services \nfrom these regions. \nENABLING THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION IN \nGROW COUNTRIES\nGrow countries have experienced rising levels \nof industrialisation, as well as higher living \nstandards in recent years. This profile’s resource \nuse is characterised by fast economic growth—\nand material consumption increasing in tandem. \nSustainable growth must, therefore, focus on using \nnatural capital more efficiently, as well as further \ndeveloping human capital. Key strategies for Grow \ncountries in ramping up their NDCs will include \nincorporating circular design in construction, with \na focus on public procurement, and safeguarding \ntheir biomass.\nFor our recommendations to be successfully \nincorporated in Grow countries, a number of enabling \nfactors may be considered. Cultural elements once \nagain come into play, as with Build countries: circular \nstrategies must engage with those that they affect \non a deep level, or the long-term uptake and success \nof those strategies will dwindle. Social co-benefits \nof the proposed interventions must be highlighted: \nfor example, farmers are generally eager to use food \nwaste as feed because it reduces their costs by up to \n60%.126 Initiatives focused on curtailing deforestation \nmust similarly provide economic incentives to those \non-the-ground to see success; research indicates \nthat providing income-generating opportunities, \nwhich will impact the lives of those that take part \nin illegal logging, are considerably more effective \nthan enforcement of law alone. 127 128 Additionally, the \nformalisation of informal workers must place people at \nthe fore, prioritising safety, health and respect. \nOnce again, stringent legislation related to multiple \nsectors—forestry and urban planning among them—\nis relevant to Grow countries’ circular transition. \nRegulations must reflect circular goals: not allowing, for \nexample, the construction of wide-laned rural roads \nin urban centres that fail to prioritise pedestrians, or \nurban sprawl that impedes walkability. Urban planning \nalso encompasses the built environment, much of \nwhich is developed and operated under government \nauthority in Grow countries—thus enabling public \nprocurement to be a key driver of the circular \nconstruction transition, boosting demand for efficient \nand secondary material use. Incorporating digital \ntechnology and making the most of new recycling \napproaches for C&DW will be crucial, and should be \ndone in tandem with the formalisation and eventual \nupskilling of the informal sector.\nPRIORITIES FOR GROW COUNTRIES’ NDCS\nThe NDCs of Grow countries are generally strong, \ncharacterised by a solid level of detail in their \nemissions mitigation plans. As the largest economy—\nand the biggest emitter—in the profile, China \nsteps to the fore as the circular economy leader, \nexhibiting a range of interventions from building up \nrecycling infrastructure and eco-industrial parks, to \nimplementing low-carbon agriculture techniques and \nreusing organic waste. \nWhile other Grow countries vary in their levels of \ndetail and target mitigation areas, most NDCs would \nbenefit from an increased focus on circularity in the \nconstruction sector—especially as urbanisation in \nthese regions will continue to spur the expansion \nof the built environment. The importance of a \nfunctioning, future-focused waste management \nsector—that both collects and segregates waste at \nscale and produces high-quality secondary materials—\nis also generally overlooked. While the urgent need \nto halt deforestation and turn to more regenerative \npractices in agriculture is generally afforded attention \nin Grow NDCs, countries moving forward must align \nlegislation with strong political action that enforces \nlaws and punishes illegal logging and burning. In the \nfuture, Grow countries can create tangible routes \nfor action by placing an even stronger emphasis on \ncircular strategies, coupled with holistic plans for \nimplementation that benefit the planet and people. \nENABLING THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION IN \nSHIFT COUNTRIES\nShift countries consume a vast volume of \nmaterials and, simultaneously, produce large \namounts of waste, falling far outside of healthy \nplanetary boundaries. A number of the social and \nenvironmental externalities that result from Shift \ncountries’ actions occur elsewhere—ultimately \nindicating that nations in this profile must further \ntake responsibility for their consumption and \nemissions. The richest 1% of the global population \naccount for more emissions than the poorest \n50%.129 As Shift countries further develop their \nnational climate pledges, they will benefit from \nstrong circular policies embedded across sectors. \nThis will also reflect the rising activism in these \nnations which is an increasingly influential factor in \nsocial change.\nIn Shift countries, which have implemented much of \ntheir housing, infrastructure and mobility systems \nand are growing at a slower pace than Build and Grow, \none priority emerges: governments must drive the \ntransition as much as possible with legislation and \npolicy. This is crucial in achieving what markets cannot: \nabolishing fossil fuel subsidies, regulating fertiliser \nand pesticide use, and enforcing stringent building \nefficiency requirements, amongst other measures. \nA second priority is shifting the attitudes and \nperceptions of populations. It will be crucial to tackle \nconsumer beliefs that typically place object ownership \non a pedestal over object sharing, 130 131 as well as beliefs \nthat enmesh success with materialism. Additional \ngovernment focus may be placed on awareness and \neducational campaigns that work to shift cultural \nbarriers, for example regarding perceptions of what \nconstitutes a healthy diet. Currently in Shift countries, \nmuch of the onus for sustainability falls on the private \nsector; it will also likely rest with producers to create \na greater market for ethically produced goods, and \nfor architectural and engineering firms, infrastructure \ndevelopers and construction companies to implement \nprinciples of circular design. \nAs with the other country profiles, all legislation or \npolicy implemented must be holistic and address and \nsupport various actors teaming up to create joint value \nthroughout the value-chain. To illustrate: consider \nthe advent of laws that prevent supermarkets from \ndestroying edible food. While well-intentioned, these \ndid not address knock-on effects. For example, food \nbanks without sufficient infrastructure for perishable \ngoods were overwhelmed by massive influxes of \ndonations, highlighting the necessity for collaboration \namong actors. 132 Furthermore, circular and sustainable \npublic procurement is one of the most effective tools \nat governments’ disposal to catalyse the transition, \nand is increasingly being recognised as a means of \nfinancing sustainable construction, for example. \nWhile collaboration is demonstrably crucial, it must \ngo hand-in-hand with strong legislation that creates \nthe conditions for circular or sustainable companies to \nflourish—while targeting those that do the opposite. To \nthis end, Shift country governments must lead the way \nin taking responsibility and corporate accountability \nfor the impact their lifestyles can have on other \ncountries, especially due to their huge reach over \nsupply chains. This must be done with strong political \nwill that doesn’t fall prey to the interests of lobbyists. \nIn 2010, for example, the newly proposed American \nClean Energy and Security Act was the ‘most promising’ \npiece of climate legislation in the US to date 133 134 —yet \nprivate-sector companies expecting losses spent more \nthan 575 million euros lobbying the bill, eventually \ndriving its failure. Novel research shows that political \nopposition against cap-and-trade climate policy can \nbe reduced by freely allocating subsets of permits \nto regulated firms, within the cap—reducing costs \nfor regulated firms yet not impacting environmental \ngoals.135 This is particularly relevant to Shift countries, \nwhich often tout market-based climate solutions.\nPRIORITIES FOR SHIFT COUNTRIES’ NDCS\nMost Shift countries are the highest global emitters \nand it is the opinion of many that the burden of climate \nmitigation should fall on their shoulders. 136 Despite \nthis, Shift action plans are largely vague, and many \ncountries in this profile are not on track to meet these \nloose goals. In the years directly succeeding the Paris \nAgreement, Shift countries’ emissions have continued \nto climb, illuminating the breadth of work to be done \n61\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n60\n\n\non overhauling the NDCs and working to implement \nstrong policy. Rising frustration at the failure of Shift \ncountries to commit to strong action has triggered \npowerful movements of climate activism in recent \nyears, especially among young people—yet more work \nremains to be done as Shift countries review their \nNDCs and climate policies in the coming years. \nCurrently, most Shift NDCs have built-in high levels of \nflexibility, and often mention target areas for reduction \nwithout detailing specific mitigation measures. In this \nway, vague goals set by governments fail to translate \nthe necessary clarity and ambition to key actors to \ndrive the change together. This has resulted in market-\nbased approaches like carbon pricing that are just too \nnarrow and weak to meet our climate goals. As long as \ncarbon remains underpriced and ambitious reduction \ntargets are only given for the distant future, Shift NDCs \ncannot reflect the mitigation ambition required—\nmassive, systemic change. Circular strategies are few \nand far between in this profile’s action plans, with the \nexception of Japan and Chile—which do list detailed \nstrategies under a broad range of mitigation areas and \nincorporate principles of circularity throughout. \nOn the whole, the transformation of energy supply, \ncircular housing, mobility and sustainable food \nsystems need more attention and speed—with these \ntransformations requiring significant investment into \ninfrastructure, policy and behavioural change, beyond \nthe functional capacities of the private sector. Now, \nin 2021, the political climate leading up to the COP26  \nforeshadows promising change: the EU parliament has \nvoted in favour of increasing the targets of Member \nStates, aiming for a 60% reduction in emissions by \n2030, while the Biden Presidency will see the US rejoin \nthe Paris Agreement. Shift countries have an excellent \nopportunity to formulate more defined blueprints, \nsupported by circular strategies, towards closing the \nEmissions Gap.\nPhoto by Sunyu Kim\n63\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n62\n\n\nTackling climate change calls for course-correction and \na systemic-thinking approach. In looking beyond single \nvariables, such as renewables or energy efficiency, we \nneed a rounded understanding of our impact on the \nworld. To achieve such a big shift, climate mitigation \nstrategies must harness the transformative power \nof the circular economy. As our report illustrates, \nthese twin agendas of change working in tandem can \ncarry us down the road to a world that is well below \n2-degrees warmer by 2032. And this massive impact \nwill—on paper—only mean upping the circularity of \nthe world by a further 8.4%.\nDoubling circularity from its current figure of 8.6% will \nrequire us to pivot away from business-as-usual—for \ngood. Yet, the take-make-waste habits of the linear \neconomy are proving very hard to shake, and time \nis not on our side. Even if every one of the current \nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) were \nfulfilled, temperatures could still rise to 3.2-degrees \nwithin this century. \nYet our report illustrates that transition pathways \nthat are systemic and transformative are available. \nWhether from the perspective of a Build, Grow or \nShift profile, countries can fulfil their societal needs \nin resource-efficient and low-carbon ways—by doing \nmore with less. By applying circular strategies at the \nintersection of materials and emissions hotspots, \ncountries can increase cycling and value-retention \nand cut excessive consumption, thereby slashing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This is how narrowing the \nCircularity Gap closes the Emissions Gap.\nBut, where do we begin? This big shift towards a more \ncircular tomorrow starts by adopting strategic steps \nto bridge the gaps through leadership and action. \nThese steps can embed circular economy principles \nand practices into the NDCs of individual countries, as \nwell as facilitate policy and market frameworks that \nexplicitly incentivise circular outcomes at all levels. \nThese linkages serve to strengthen and align local \nactions with global aims.\nThe steps also bring people together and make \nconnections across national, cultural, societal, sectoral \nand professional boundaries—to enable collaborative \nendeavours and engender collective responsibility. \n8. THE WAY FORWARD\nFrom knowledge sharing to brand allyship, this \ncoalition of the willing is a powerful agent for \naccelerating change. In the short term, our roadmap \nto a well below 2-degree world should leverage the \npolicy-making platform provided by the upcoming \nCOP26. It must, though, look beyond Glasgow, and \ntowards longer-term climate legislation, too. Our \nvision for closing the Circularity Gap needs to be both \nambitious and actionable.\nIf the events of 2020 taught us anything, it is that \nwe can think the unthinkable and even do the \nundoable. Climate mitigation and a circular economy \nare undoubtedly difficult; but, together, they are not \nundoable.\nBRIDGE THE GAPS THROUGH \nLEADERSHIP AND ACTION\n \n1. Build a coalition for action that is both diverse and \ninclusive. Bringing a diverse community of businesses, \ngovernments, NGOs and academics together to boost \ncapacity and capability will accelerate collective action \ntoward circularity, serving the betterment of societal needs \nand global ecological health. This will enable action toward \nreaching the Paris Agreement’s goals before it’s too late and \nbegin to build the necessary infrastructure and alliances to \ncollect, retrieve and share circular knowledge on a global \nlevel.\n2. Integrate plans for leveraging the circular economy \ninto national climate pledges.  Circular strategies suited \nto different country profiles can get nations back on a well \nbelow 2-degree pathway. Integrating tailored plans can also \nenable better goal-setting, measurement and benchmarking \nfor countries in the NDC revision process, and ensure that \neach nation can address global issues in a way that aligns to \ntheir local context, incentives and mandates. This can also \nsupport key industries that need to shoulder the change.\n3. Create an enabling environment to facilitate the \ncircular transition. Market and regulatory failures that \ninhibit the enabling conditions needed for circular initiatives \nto reach scale can be addressed by policymakers; including \nsteering away from financial models that only support linear \nprojects. Capital must also be mobilised toward circular \ninitiatives to unlock the potential of ‘building back better’.\nPhoto by Denys Nevozhai\n65\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n64\n\n\n1.

Throughout this report ‘material handling and use’ is \nintended as the whole supply chain of materials—the \ncombination of all production and consumption activities \nthat are in place to meet material-related needs of final \nconsumers. It is therefore an allocation choice that—at \nits extreme—includes all emissions except passenger \nmobility and energy use for residential purposes (space, \nwater heating and lighting). For instance, emissions \nrelated to freight transport could be considered as \n‘energy related’ since they involve the combustion of \noil derivatives. However, since they ultimately serve \nmaterial needs—namely moving consumer goods \naround—we decided to consider them as being \nultimately material-related.\n4.

Yet, updating the \nCircularity Metric is not feasible on an annual basis \ndue to the limited availability of data.

      "content": "Enacted globally, a circular economy can close the \nEmissions Gap.  This study shows that combining \nthe twin agendas of circular economy and climate \nmitigation gets us on a path to a well below 2-degree \nworld by 2032. In adopting a roadmap packed with \ncircular strategies, we can pave the way for the \nsystemic transformations needed to course-correct \nthe global economy—going far beyond the limitations \nof current policy and national climate pledges. The \ncurrent pledges bring us over 15% of the way; the \ncircular economy delivers the other 85%. If the coming \ndecade is the decisive one for humanity’s future on \nearth, then 2021 is the year to ramp up our efforts \nto bring our goals into realistic reach and prevent \nthe worst effects of climate breakdown. Our current \neconomy is only 8.6% circular, leaving a massive \nCircularity Gap. The good news is that we only need to \nclose the Gap by a further 8.4%—or roughly double the \ncurrent global figure of 8.6%—to get there.\nHowever, circularity in our 8.6% world is trending \ndown, not up. Whilst the Circularity Gap Report 2020  \nrevealed that the global economy was only 8.6% \ncircular, just two years earlier it was 9.1%—things have \ngot worse. So, although we only need to almost double \ncircularity to close the Emissions Gap by 2032, the \nglobe remains shackled by outdated ‘take-make-waste’ \npractices. Humanity has now also breached two major \nmilestones: the world is consuming 100 billion tonnes \n(Gt) of materials and it is 1-degree warmer. Due to data \nunavailability, the Circularity Metric was not updated \nfor this year, yet all indicators point to the reality that \nthe globe remains engulfed by the linear economy and \nits unsustainable practices, processes and behaviours. \nHowever, when the covid-19 pandemic swept the \nworld in 2020, we saw empty skies and roads, as entire \npopulations were placed under national lockdown. \nTemporary as the resulting  drop in annual global \nemissions may be, it has shown us what is possible: \nfrom governments to citizens, we are now armed with \nthe knowledge that transformational change is doable. \nAnd time is running out. Even if all countries that \npledged climate action as part of the Paris Agreement \nfulfil their emissions-cutting promises, the rise in \ntemperatures is still forecast to hit 3.2-degrees this \nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\ncentury.1 Global warming shows no signs of slowing \nand the reality is that certain vulnerable cities and \ncountries will face catastrophes that threaten much \nof the population. 2 And in a cruel irony, lower-\nincome nations who contribute the fewest emissions \nare also most vulnerable to the impacts of climate \nbreakdown. We are already past the point of minor \namends. Course-correction will require a major, \ntransformational gear-change in systemic thinking. \nThis big shift is the circular economy.\nClimate breakdown demands more than current \nclimate pledges can deliver.  This Circularity Gap \nReport  quantitatively maps how greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions and resources move through our \neconomy, from extraction to end-of-use. What we \nfind is that material handling and use 3 accounts for \nthe vast majority (70%) of GHGs 4 emitted. This proves \nhow vital it is to look beyond the narrow energy focus \nof the current climate pledges to make a real impact. \nBy applying circular strategies at the intersection of \nmaterials and emissions hotspots, we can increase \nvalue-retention and cut excessive consumption, \nthereby slashing GHGs. This is how narrowing the \nCircularity Gap, in turn, closes the Emissions Gap.\nA circular economy can satisfy societal needs and \nwants by doing more with less. We need materials to \nfuel our lifestyles; this produces emissions. However, \nthe circular economy ensures that with less material \ninput and fewer emissions, we can still deliver the \nsame, or better, output. Through smart strategies \nand reduced material consumption, we find that the \ncircular economy has the power to shrink global GHG \nemissions by 39%  and cut virgin resource use by 28% . \nWithin this, the societal need of Housing delivers half \nof the impact, while Mobility and Nutrition account for \nmuch of the rest. To get to our end goal of a socially \njust and ecologically safe space 5, we need intelligent \nresource management to stem consumption and \ncut emissions, so their impact falls within planetary \nboundaries. \nCountries: another year lost in the race to get it \nright.  No country is firmly on the path to achieving \nour goal of a socially just and ecologically safe space. 6 \nThey do, though, wield power—especially now. \nEconomic stimulus packages to pull countries out of \ntheir post-pandemic slumps are rolling out and the \ncrunch UN summit, the COP26, has been postponed \nto Autumn 2021. This means we have lost valuable \ntime to accelerate action, especially as the majority \nof countries were not on track to update their already \n‘woefully inadequate’ 7 climate pledges by the end of \n2020.8 To guide this process, we examine the common \nchallenges and opportunities for three overarching \ncountry profiles and present blueprints for action \ntailored to each context and set of unique climate \npledges. For countries, this truly is their time.\nThis is the real year of truth. With 2020 struck \nby covid-19, lockdowns around the globe not only \ncontributed to a sharp decline in emissions, but \nalso accelerated decommissioning of fossil assets. 9 \nDespite this progress being unintended and arguably \ntemporary, it can teach us valuable lessons to translate \ninto structural change—and now, the world seems \nto be listening. Emboldened by universal uptake of \nrenewables, governments are making decisions that \nwill positively shape our climate future. The events \nof 2020 also served to hold a magnifying glass to the \nflaws in our system—an unsustainably linear system \nreliant on the exploitation of nature and people—\nand there is no environmental justice, without social \njustice. Destructive and instructive as the pandemic \nproved, it is ultimately climate breakdown that will be \nthe biggest global health-threat of the century. 10 In a \ntime of building back better, the circular economy has \nnever been more relevant.\n9\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n8\n",

Build a coalition for action that is both diverse and \ninclusive. Bringing a diverse community of businesses, \ngovernments, NGOs and academics together to boost \ncapacity and capability will accelerate collective action \ntoward circularity, serving the betterment of societal needs \nand global ecological health. This will enable action toward \nreaching the Paris Agreement’s goals before it’s too late and \nbegin to build the necessary infrastructure and alliances to \ncollect, retrieve and share circular knowledge on a global \nlevel.\n2. Integrate plans for leveraging the circular economy \ninto national climate pledges.  Circular strategies suited \nto different country profiles can get nations back on a well \nbelow 2-degree pathway. Integrating tailored plans can also \nenable better goal-setting, measurement and benchmarking \nfor countries in the NDC revision process, and ensure that \neach nation can address global issues in a way that aligns to \ntheir local context, incentives and mandates. This can also \nsupport key industries that need to shoulder the change.\n3. Create an enabling environment to facilitate the \ncircular transition. Market and regulatory failures that \ninhibit the enabling conditions needed for circular initiatives \nto reach scale can be addressed by policymakers; including \nsteering away from financial models that only support linear \nprojects. Capital must also be mobilised toward circular \ninitiatives to unlock the potential of ‘building back better’.\nPhoto by Ivan Bandura\n11\nThe Circularity Gap Report  202110\n",

      "content": "Humanity is living beyond the means of Planet \nEarth. Our use of finite resources continues to spiral \nupward; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue \nto disperse into the air. The earth continues to heat \nup. It is becoming clear that we’re running out of \ntime to course-correct. Yet, in light of rapid global \nchange, since the covid-19 pandemic struck in March \n2020, the world is finally waking up. Covid-19 has \ndisrupted business-as-usual. Climate breakdown, \nresource scarcity and ecological collapse have \nmoved from the horizon to the now, as shocks and \ncrises have exposed the fragility of our current, \nlinear system. Calls to ‘build back better’ with a \ngreen recovery—thereby mending the impacts of \nthe pandemic in a way that also addresses climate \nbreakdown—are strong. This 2021 edition of the \nCircularity Gap Report quantifies the huge synergistic \nand transformational power the circular economy \nholds for the climate mitigation agenda—just in \ntime for this year’s crunch UN summit that will  \npave our future climate pathways. In getting \nsmarter about our global resource use and \nconsumption, we can close the globe’s widening \nCircularity and Emissions Gaps. Closing both Gaps \ntogether will put us firmly back on a path toward \nthe goal of the Paris Agreement: limiting warming  \nto well below 2-degrees. \n1 BILLION TONNES, 1-DEGREE GLOBAL \nWARMING\nIn our 2020 Circularity Gap Report , we recorded a \nbleak, first-time milestone: 100 billion tonnes of \nmaterials enter the global economy every year. These \nmaterials are funnelled through our economy and \nallow us to continue our way of life. However, of \nthis massive amount, only 8.6% is cycled back into \nthe economy. For the past 200 years at least, the \nhallmark of global consumption and resource use \ncan be aptly described as ‘take-make-waste’: a linear \neconomy. Whilst this model has enabled vast growth, \na defining characteristic has unfortunately been huge \noverconsumption to the detriment of planetary health. \nFurthermore, despite bringing prosperity to some of \nthe population, some of the time, global social equity \nhas also been negatively impacted. In many parts of the \nworld, linear over-consumption has effectively become \nthe norm, whilst elsewhere, minimum living standards \nare not even being reached.\nIn 2017, we passed another bleak milestone: the \nthreshold of human activities causing 1-degree global \nwarming.11 In 2020, we reached 1.1-degrees. 12 To date, \nthe last five years have broken successive weather \nrecords and—even if the current climate pledges, \nthe Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), \nare followed—the global rise in temperatures is still \nforecast to hit 3.2-degrees this century. 13 This is an \nalarming number; the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) has warned that going beyond \n1.5-degrees alone will increase the frequency and \nintensity of climate impacts. In a 3-degree warming \nsituation, the globe risks being drowned by climate \nextremes such as floods, droughts and wildfires, \nall of which displace populations and increase food \ninsecurity. Global GHG emissions reached record highs \nin 2018, and despite dips following lockdown-lifestyles \ndue to covid-19, we are still far off track. This difference \nbetween ‘where we are likely to be and where we need \nto be’ has become known as the Emissions Gap.\nFIVE YEARS SINCE THE PARIS AGREEMENT\nThere has been, however, globally coordinated action \non climate breakdown. According to United Nations \nClimate Change, in 2015; 196 countries signed the \nParis Agreement. Worldwide climate action was set \nout: mitigation of climate change by limiting the \naverage global temperature rise this century to well \nbelow 2-degrees; support for lower-income nations \nand transparent reporting of climate goals. Things \ncould only get better—or so was the presumption. \nIt is now clear, though, that the blueprints mapped \nout for the globe in the form of national climate \npromises—NDCs—were never powerful enough \nto fulfil the Agreement’s well below 2-degree goal. \nWith a prevailing focus on renewable energy and an \nincremental focus on industries, they will not get us \nwhere we need to be. And in the five years that have \npassed since Paris, large gaps between promises and \nimplementation have emerged. With every year of \nslow progress, the challenge grows. More extreme \naction is necessary. However, what should have been \na pivotal moment for updating and strengthening the \nNDCs was missed: the COP26 in 2020 was cancelled \nand postponed to November 2021 due to the covid-19 \npandemic. As a result, 2021 has become a pivotal year \nfor climate action—the decisions we make this year will \nshape our future climate.\n1. INTRODUCTION\n13\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n12\n",

There are also many facilitating factors that \nmake now a perfect time for action. 20 Renewable energy \nprices are dropping and if China and the EU continue  \nto invest in wind, solar and batteries, they will fall \nfurther, while climate legislation may see the price of  \ncarbon-intensive materials rise. \nTHE POWER OF COUNTRIES\nIn making these future-shaping decisions, countries \nclearly have potential—and potential is power. From \ndetermining the focus of each country’s NDC to \nfunnelling capital toward future-oriented innovation, \ntheir role is massive. The NDCs now largely focus on \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as \ncurbing emissions from land use, land-use change and \nforestry. Looking ahead, circular economy strategies \ncould be employed to support countries in identifying \nand developing mitigation options which go beyond \ncurrent pledges, both in scope and ambition.  \nBut different countries should take different paths. \nDifferent country profiles, although operating under \nsimilar overarching global trends, need to problem-\nsolve very differently and the implementation of circular \nstrategies will, therefore, differ between localities. \nHigher-income nations, that are responsible for the \noverwhelming majority of historical emissions, need \nto shift away from current linear paradigms that fuel \noverconsumption of the earth’s resources—and fast. \nEconomies that are still growing, or rapidly building,  \ncan navigate away from linearity now so that they don’t \nface the same challenges in the future. With this in mind, \nthis Circularity Gap Report tailors its global roadmap \nfor different country profiles in Chapter Six to deliver \nactionable roadmaps. In Chapter Seven, we dive into  \nthe on-the-ground barriers to the circular transition,  \nand recommend points of change for countries’ NDCs.  \nWith the pandemic, we have lost a valuable year \nto accelerate action. But the urgency is now more \napparent and the collective attitude more accepting of \nfundamental change. This report can guide countries \nin this process of making the course-correction we so \ndesperately need. For countries, this truly is their time.\nSAME GLOBAL NEEDS, RADICALLY FEWER \nMATERIALS AND EMISSIONS\nWhat this report will ultimately do is show the power \nof the circular economy to fulfil our global needs and \nwants, but with radically fewer materials and emissions. \nThe circular economy ensures that with less input, \nwe can deliver improved prosperity. This will require \nmore than just a focus on renewable energy: it calls \nfor transformational course-correction that not only \nencourages behavioural changes, but prompts a total \noverhaul of linear activities. In this report, we are also \ncareful to examine ethical considerations and  \ntrade-offs that could potentially arise in the transition  \nto circularity. The circular economy must not perpetuate \nthe same mistakes of the linear economy, which relies \non the continued exploitation of both people and planet. \nWe therefore pinpoint the seven core societal needs \nand wants that guide our research: Housing, Nutrition, \nMobility, Communications, Services, Consumables and \nHealthcare. Central to our proposition is ensuring that \nour roadmap for a well below 2-degree world is built \nupon scenarios that are resource efficient, but also \npeople-centric; the impact of one circular strategy could \nhave vastly different repercussions on communities in \ndifferent localities and this must be taken into account. \nThere is no environmental justice without social justice.  \nThe Circularity Gap Report approach shows the potential \nbenefits of circular economy solutions to trigger \ngovernment and company action with ‘what if’ scenarios. \nConsider this when interpreting the figures we use in \nour roadmap (detailed in Chapter Four), such as ‘cutting \nvirgin resource use by 28%’. This is important because \nours is not a dynamic modelling analysis (as used in \nthe Emissions Gap Reports): material extraction and \nemissions are not forecasted to 2030 or 2050, nor do our \ninterventions and scenarios account for technological or \nsocio-economic trends occurring in that period.\nAIMS OF THE CIRCULARITY\nGAP REPORT 2021\n1. Illustrate and quantify the mutually reinforcing \nrelationship of the circular economy and the climate \nmitigation agenda.\n2. Demonstrate the power of circular economy \nstrategies to close the Circularity Gap and the \nEmissions Gap and help us reach the goals of the \nParis Agreement.\n3. Accordingly, identify key interventions for  \nimpact, based on the needs of society, that are  \nresource-smart and low-emission. \n4. Identify how our scenarios can be tailored to \nnational levels to inform goal-setting and NDC \nrevision.\n5. Identify key pathways for three distinct country \nprofiles to transition towards the safe and just space.\nTHE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AS A MEANS  \nTO AN END\nSociety now finds itself at a historic economic and \ncultural crossroads. Do we continue to tweak and \ntamper with our broken linear model, cognisant of the \nconsequences and liable by default? Or, do we pivot \nto a new model—such as the circular economy—with \nfresh minds and new tools to pursue a desirable and \ndeliverable paradigm shift?\nThe circular economy holds the promise for systemic \ntransformation of our society, as its core tenants design \nout waste and pollution, keep products and materials \nin use and regenerate natural systems. 14 However, the \ncircular economy is also an action agenda with impact \nthat extends beyond resource efficiency. As a multi-\nstakeholder model, its systems-thinking approach \nboosts capacity and capability to serve universal \nsocietal needs. This circular framework aligns with \na vision of a more resource-aligned, people-centric \nfuture. But getting there will not be easy. A full circular \ntransition calls for creative innovation in systems design \nand rigorous collaboration across and within value-\nchains, plus among multiple stakeholders. Change may \nbe difficult, but it is necessary. Closing the Circularity \nGap serves the higher objective of preventing further \nand accelerated environmental degradation and social \ninequality. In moving the globe toward an ecologically \nsafe and socially just operating space for humankind, \nthe circular economy is a critical pathway. 15 \nIn our analysis, we have found that the vast majority \n(70%) of emissions 16 are associated with material \nhandling and use, demonstrating the clear and \nnecessary role for circular economy strategies—which \nlook to do more with less—in emissions reduction. The \naim of this report is to provide a quantified link between \nthe circular economy and climate mitigation agenda. \nWe create an x-ray of global emissions to unpack the \nblinking lights of climate breakdown and locate where \nemissions-material hotspots are to be found in our \neconomy. Building on this analysis, we set out both \nglobal and regional treatment plans to get us back on a \nwell below 2-degree and circular path.\nTHE REAL YEAR OF TRUTH\n2020 was struck by covid-19. The pandemic served \nto unite the global population in one sentiment: \nvulnerability—the vulnerability of our economy, of our \nenvironment and, ultimately, our future on earth. 17 \nCalls for a green recovery in alignment with other global \nchallenges have never been louder, and many see a \nrare opportunity like no other to build a resilient and \nlow-carbon economic future. The circular economy, \nas a tangible way of achieving this vision, is now more \nrelevant than ever. \nGovernments around the world are now making huge \ndecisions that will shape our climate future. Firstly, \nas a result of the impacts of the pandemic, stimulus \npackages designed to pull us out of economic slumps \nmean governments are now making decisions on \nhow to spend capital that could build back better and \nhelp set new goals for resilience and preparedness. \nAlternatively, in thrall to business-as-usual, they might \ninstead leave us vulnerable, divided and susceptible. \nThese stimulus packages could, for example, drive a \nhuge uptake in renewable energy, which in turn would \nspur jobs. The 2020 Emissions Gap report , which calls for \na green recovery, notes that around one-quarter of G20 \nmembers have dedicated shares of their spending, up \nto 3% of GDP, to low-carbon measures. For most others, \nspending has mostly been high-carbon or neutral. 18  \nMoreover, high hopes were being pinned by many on  \nthe COP26 UN summit supposed to take place in 2020, \nbut rescheduled for Autumn 2021. Therefore, how \ncountries move forward with their NDCs following the \nevents of the past year—and how governments take \naction to implement their pledges—can and will shape \nthe future of our climate for years to come.\nA GLOBAL COALITION TOWARD \nDECARBONISATION?\nThe encouraging announcements from a number \nof countries calling for a green recovery in 2020 \nlargely placed net-zero at the heart of action. Capital \nfunds enforced significant divestments in the fossil \nindustry. 19  So, are we seeing a global coalition toward \ndecarbonisation? Sweden, the UK, France, Denmark, \nNew Zealand, Hungary, China (which alone is responsible \nfor 28% of global emissions), South Korea and Japan \nall have a net-zero target in place by law (albeit with \ndifferent goal years). The recent election success of the \nBiden administration means the US will also rejoin the \nParis Agreement and the new President promises to \ndelivery net-zero emissions by 2050. Also, the European \nGreen Deal has stated the ambition to be the first zero \nemissions continent by 2050 with a specific Circular \nEconomy Action Plan as part of the roadmap. These \nrecent emissions-reduction pledges, especially from \nthe US and China, could potentially bring the world on a \n15\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n14\n",

In particular, two resource types \nare used: the materials to build transport \ntechnologies and vehicles like cars, trains \nand aeroplanes; plus, predominantly, the \nfossil fuels burned to power them.\nNUTRITION\nAlso with a large footprint is the need \nfor nutrition, which includes agricultural \nproducts such as crops and livestock. \nFood products have short lifecycles in \nour economy, being consumed quickly \nafter production.\nCONSUMABLES\nConsumables are a diverse and complex \ngroup of products —such as refrigerators, \nclothing, cleaning agents and paints —\nthat generally have short to medium \nlifetimes. Textiles, including clothing, also \nconsume different kinds of resources \nsuch as cotton, synthetic materials like \npolyester, dye pigments, and chemicals.\nHEALTHCARE\nWith an expanding, ageing and, on average, \nmore prosperous population, healthcare \nservices are increasing globally. Buildings \naside, typical resource groups include use  \nof capital equipment such as x-ray \nmachines, pharmaceuticals, hospital \noutfittings (beds), disposables and \nhomecare equipment.\nCOMMUNICATION\nCommunication is becoming an ever-\nmore important aspect of today’s \nsociety, provided by a mix of equipment \nand technology ranging from personal \nmobile devices to data centres. Increased \nconnectivity is also an enabler of the \ncircular economy, where digitisation can \nmake physical products obsolete, or \nenable far better use of existing assets, \nincluding consumables, building stock or \ninfrastructure.\nSERVICES\nThe delivery of services to society ranges \nfrom education and public services to \ncommercial services like banking and \ninsurance. The material and emissions \nfootprint is modest in total and typically \ninvolves the use of professional  \nequipment, office furniture, computers  \nand other infrastructure.\nSEVEN SOCIETAL NEEDS & WANTS\nHOUSING\nThe need that represents the largest \nresource and emissions footprint is \nfor construction and maintenance of \nresidential houses, especially in lower-\nincome nations.\nPhoto by Yogendra Singh\n17\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n16\n",

Alongside our \nwidening Circularity Gap, the world is heating up.  \nIn 2017, for the first time, humanity consumed \nmore than 100 billion tonnes of materials and  \nincreased the mean global temperature by more \nthan 1-degree above pre-industrial level. 21 We need \nto course-correct. Therefore, this year we—in a \nfirst for the Circularity Gap Report —have created \nan x-ray of how global greenhouse gas emissions \nflow along through different value-adding stages \nof the economy. By taking an approach to global \nresource use that considers both mass and carbon, \nwe can consume fewer materials, increase value-re -\ntention and increase cycling back into the economy, \nwhilst simultaneously slashing emissions. In the \nface of mounting urgency, the solutions we apply to \nour situation must also be multidimensional. \nX-RAY OF OUR GLOBAL ECONOMY\nIn the first edition of the Circularity Gap Report released \nin 2018, we asked ourselves: how circular is the global \neconomy today? Supplying an answer to that question, \nas well as insights into key global levers to move us \ntoward circularity, are crucial for us to plan our path \nforward. Three consecutive reports have contributed \nto developing these insights, as well as bolstering \nmetrics for circularity as a discipline. We now know \nhow circular the globe is and what we need to do to \nclose the Gap.\nIt soon became clear how the circular economy has to \ndo more than look at material flows alone. In our 2019 \nreport, we introduced the Mass-Value-Carbon (MVC) \nnexus, a concept that looks at how much greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions (Carbon) and value-created (Value) \nget distributed through meeting our key societal \nneeds and wants with materials (Mass). Building on \nour MVC nexus concept and profoundly deepening \nour exploration, this report will scrutinise how global \nGHG emissions arise from the extraction, processing \nand use of resources. Following our signature style of \nproviding one single visual that gives an overview of \nthe entire global economy’s material flows, we will now \npresent one for global GHG emissions: our x-ray of \nglobal GHG emissions.\nPhoto by Jeremy Bishop\n19\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021",

But \nfirst, we need to know where these emissions stem from \nto reduce them. Our emissions x-ray, Figure One, shows \nus how the vast majority of GHG emissions (70%) are \nultimately generated through material handling and use \n(at the Provide  level)—whether for the clothes we wear, \nthe phones we own, or the meals we eat. In illustrating \nhow 59.1 billion tonnes of emissions flow along and across \nglobal value-chains, Figure One allows us to gain a deeper \nunderstanding of the upstream drivers of those emissions. \nIn doing so, the necessity for integrated policies that \naddress embodied emissions becomes clear. 24 25\nBeginning from the left-hand side, we see how four \ntypes of resources—fossil fuels, minerals, ores and \nbiomass—are extracted ( Take) and put to use in \nthe global economy. Fossil fuels are responsible \nfor by far the most global embodied emissions \n(65%), with petroleum fueling much of the globe’s \ntransportation, plus coal and natural gas providing \ninputs for electricity, heat and industrial processes. \nThe second-largest source of embodied emissions is \nthe production of biomass through agricultural and \nforestry processes, with significant emissions (26%) \nrelated to LULUCF. This delivers us food products, \ntimber and fuelwood, as well as fibres for the textiles \nindustry. The extraction, basic processing and use \nof both ores and minerals (together with waste \nhandling) have the smallest emissions contribution, in \nrelative terms (8%), with calcination of cement  \nkiln being the most emissions-intensive  \nnon-combustion process.\nIt is interesting to observe how the switch between \nthe emissions related to materials and energy occurs. \nNotice that before energy carriers such as oil, gas, \ncoal and fuelwood undergo transformation ( Process ) \ninto refined materials, and energy and heat, they \nrepresent the majority of the emissions (70%); while, \nat this stage, materials are only responsible for 30% 26 \n27 (broken down into 23% material processing and 7% \nwaste management and LULUCF). These materials for \nindustry and construction then enter manufacturing \nand industrial processes in the form of plastic, rubber, \niron, cement and wood products.  \nEnergy carriers such as oil, gas, coal and\nfuelwood travel through the economy\nKey points in the value-chain (from Process  to Provide ) \nwhere emissions embodied in energy carriers and  \nmaterials shift and eventually switch\n21\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n20\n",

      "content": "Added to these materials is process heat and \nelectricity, as well as energy carriers such as oil \nderivatives, gas and coal. \nThey are then transformed ( Produce) into products \nsuch as electronics, capital equipment, construction \nmaterials and food. At this point, the balance between \nemissions related to energy versus materials has \nshifted to be almost fifty-fifty. Materials together \nrepresent 51% of all emissions, while the energy \nused to heat and cool buildings, light our homes \nand workspaces, as well as the energy that is used \nfor personal and freight transport, represents the \nremaining 49%. However, ultimately—at the point of \nfinal consumption ( Provide)—both freight transport \nand the lighting, heating and cooling of non-residential \nbuildings also serve material purposes: the emissions \nrelated to energy become 30% and materials, 70%. \nNow, a huge proportion of the emissions that were at \nfirst associated with energy carriers have gradually \nbecome embodied into finished goods and services \nwhich, in turn, satisfy the seven societal needs. \nEMISSIONS-INTENSIVE HOUSING,  \nMOBILITY AND NUTRITION\nProviding Mobility , Housing  and Nutrition  to the \nworld accounts for almost 70% of global emissions. \nMobility  leads the way with an emissions footprint \nof 17.1 billion tonnes. This is primarily the result \nof fossil fuel combustion across passenger and \nfreight transport. The production of automobiles, \ntrucks, trains and aeroplanes is relatively limited in \nemissions contributions. Responsible for the second-\nlargest footprint is Housing , at 13.5 billion tonnes of \nemissions. Housing’s  hefty footprint comes down \nto the vast extraction, transport and construction \nactivities it entails, as well as the energy used to light, \nheat and cool dwellings. Third in line is the provision of \nfood for Nutrition  with 10 billion tonnes of emissions. \nLULUCF associated with the production of food, but \nalso fibres and clearing for expansion of urban centres, \nis responsible for about 4  billion tonnes of emissions \n(high uncertainty). \nThe remaining 30% of emissions flow into satisfying \nCommunications , Services , Consumables  and \nHealthcare . At 6.4 billion tonnes of emissions, \nServices  is the biggest of the smaller needs. The \nfootprint for service provision includes the buildings \nand energy required for educational institutions, \nmuseums and other public-service properties, as \nwell as the material needs for their functioning. \nCommunication  is responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes \nof emissions. These largely fuel communication \ninfrastructure as well data storage and communication \ndevices. The broad group of Consumables  accounts \nfor 5.6 billion tonnes of emissions for the production \nof clothing, personal health products and consumer \nelectronics. With the smallest footprint of all the \nsocietal needs and wants, Healthcare’s  footprint \nof 3 billion tonnes is mostly related to hospital \nbuildings, healthcare equipment such as MRI scanners \nand the production of medical disposables and \npharmaceuticals. \nDEVISING A TREATMENT PLAN THROUGH  \nA MASS-CARBON LENS\nWe now want to complement the insights the \nemissions x-ray has given us with the reality of material \nuse in our global economy. Material transformation \noffers the prospect of adding value at each step \nof the supply chain—from simple raw materials, \nthrough to complex products. As part of the same \nprocess, however, emissions and waste are generated. \nTherefore, when considering our economic activity \nmore holistically, we need to adopt different lenses—\nhere Mass-Carbon—to scrutinise the combined inputs \nand outputs from these steps and understand fully \nhow these activities contribute to meeting our societal \nneeds. In combining the material and emissions \nfootprints in Figure Two, we can see the multiple \navenues that hold the most impact from a  \nMass-Carbon perspective. \nBy revealing how both materials and emissions flow \nthrough the economy, Figure Two shows us that for \nsome societal needs, the focus areas where we can \nclose the Emissions Gap overlap with the focus areas to \nclose the Circularity Gap. Yet for other societal needs, \nthere is no overlap, and we must adapt our approach \naccordingly. From a material (Mass) perspective, \nMinerals  represent by far the largest share (51%), \nwhile they only make a minor contribution from an \nGHG emissions (Carbon) perspective (2.8%). That said, \nthere are still ‘hot spots’ along the mineral value-chain \nthat are exceptionally emissions-intensive, which we \nshould aim to bypass by applying circular strategies \n(as in the case of cement clinker production). The \nopposite is true for fossil fuels : in terms of materials \nthey represent a modest share of 15%, yet they are \nresponsible for 65% of emissions. These resources are \nalmost entirely used for combustion purposes.  \nRESOURCES & EMISSIONS\nTHE GLOBAL ECONOMY\nSOCIETAL NEEDS\nHOUSING\nCOMMUNICATION\nCONSUMABLES\nHEALTHCARE\nMOBILITY\nSERVICES\nNUTRITION\nORES\nFOSSIL \nFUELS\nBIOMASS\nMINERALS\n38.8 Gt\n13.5 Gt\nWASTE\n5.6 Gt\n3.5 Gt\n10.0 Gt\n6.4 Gt\n6.9 Gt\n5.6 Gt\n21.3 Gt\n10 Gt\n1.9 Gt\n16 Gt\n24.6 Gt\n38.4 Gt\n15.1 Gt\n10.1 Gt\n1.2 Gt\n50.8 Gt\n1.6 Gt\n8.7 Gt\n17.1 Gt\n9.3 Gt\n3 Gt\nEMISSIONS CO 2eq\nTHE GLOBAL\nECONOMY\nThis ﬁgure shows the material throughput \n(Mass) and GHG emissions (Carbon) \nassociated with the four resources (minerals, \nores, fossil fuels and biomass) on the left and \non the right the Mass-Carbon proﬁles for the \nseven societal needs.\nIt assesses the global economy through two \nlenses that are critical to circularity: \nemissions (Carbon) and materials (Mass). \nApplying Mass-Carbon thinking, it will assess \nboth the carbon emissions footprint, as well \nas the mass factors, behind meeting key \nsocietal needs, such as Housing, Mobility and \nNutrition. This analysis can, therefore, help to \nshow which societal needs consume what \nresources and cause GHG emissions. \nFigure Two The global resource and emissions footprint behind \nmeeting key societal needs, side by side. Units in billion \ntonnes (Gt).\nThe energy-density properties of fossil carriers \nmake them very lucrative as a commodity, but it is \nimpossible to bypass any steps in the value-chain \ndue to the very nature of their use. This is why we see \nfossil fuels as having no place in the circular economy. \nBiomass is responsible for around 25% of materials \nand 27% of emissions, yet as a resource it represents \nan interesting case: biomass captures carbon from the \natmosphere during its growth, but again is often used \nas an energy carrier, thereby eventually producing \nemissions. In applying circular strategies, we would \npromote the increase of carbon storage in biomass \n(through, for example, the use of wooden construction \nmaterials), while bypassing the emissions-producing \nsteps in the value-chain.\nIn using circular strategies, we can reconfigure these \nsupply chains to ‘bypass’ the emissions hot-spots.  \nBy swapping out emission-intensive processes such as \nsmelting and remanufacturing for metals, for example, \nwith processes that extend the lifespan of the material, \nsuch as repair, we would reduce the need for excess \nvirgin material extraction and emit fewer GHGs. We \nput this to the test in our roadmap to a well below \n2-degree world, which is presented in Chapter Four. \n*Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) is defined \nby the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat as a \n’greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and \nremovals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct human-\ninduced land use such as settlements and commercial uses, \nland-use change, and forestry activities.’ We include LULUCF \nbecause it is included in the Emissions Gap and because \nthey are important in the estimation of sustainably sourced \n(carbon-neutral)—and thus circular—biomass. \n23\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n22\n",

Consistent measurement \nframeworks should inform governments and \nbusinesses alike to engage in uniform goal-setting \nand guide future action toward circularity and \nclimate mitigation in the most impactful way. \nIn last year’s Circularity Gap Report , we saw the \nglobal Circularity Metric go from 9.1% to 8.6%, \ndemonstrating the power of having a single, \noverarching metric to track progress and change. \nAnd now in this fourth edition of the Report, \nwe present robust, quantified evidence to show \nhow the circular economy and climate mitigation \nagenda are mutually reinforcing by using both \nthe Circularity Gap and the Emissions Gap to \nillustrate our case. What the findings tell us is that \ngovernments wanting to satisfy our societal needs \nand wants within healthy planetary boundaries \nneed a roadmap and fresh strategies.\nWHY THE CIRCULAR TRANSITIONS\nNEEDS METRICS\nWe need metrics and measurements to search for and \nidentify solutions and to help monitor and report our \nprogress in alleviating problems. Our Circularity Metric \nmeasures the circularity of the globe, and in providing \nan initial assessment of how wide the Circularity Gap \nis, the analysis provides an insight into where circular \nopportunities and priorities lie in material flows. By \nmeasuring circularity in this way, businesses and \ngovernments can track their circular performance over \ntime and put trends into context, as well as engage in \nuniform goal-setting and guide future action in the \nmost impactful way.\nTHE CIRCULARITY METRIC AND GAP\nThe circular economy is a big picture and holistic idea. \nUltimately, it is a means to an end—a socially just \nand ecologically safe space. Exactly how the circular \ntransition can deliver more beneficial social and \nenvironmental outcomes is not a question with just \none right answer however. There is no simple straight-\nline solution and the feedback loops in the system \nrun in all directions. 28 In particular, three connected \nspheres need to be taken into account: how resources \nare put to work to deliver social outcomes via \nprovisioning systems. Provisioning systems comprise \nof physical systems such as road infrastructure, \ntechnologies, and their efficiencies 29 and social \nsystems, which include government institutions, \nbusinesses, communities and markets. 30\nProvisioning systems are the essential link between \nbiophysical resource use and social outcomes. \nFor example, different forms of transportation \ninfrastructure (railways versus motorways or  \ncar-sharing versus car ownership) can generate  \nsimilar social outcomes, but at very different levels  \nof material use.\nIn capturing one overarching measurement of \ncircularity, we need to reduce this complexity \nsomewhat. So, we take the metabolism of the globe—\nhow materials flow through the economy and are in \nlong-term use—as the starting point. This approach \nbuilds on and is inspired by the work of Haas et al. 31 \n(2015). Taking the x-ray of the globe’s material use,  \nwe consider six fundamental dynamics of what the  \ncircular economy transition aims to establish and how  \nit can do so. This translates into two objectives and  \nfour strategies, which we base on the work of  \nBocken et al. (2016): 32 \n• Objective one:  Resource extraction from the \nlithosphere is minimised and biomass production \nand extraction is regenerative. \n• Objective two:  The dispersion and loss of \nmaterials is minimised, meaning all technical \nmaterials have high recovery opportunities, ideally \nwithout degradation and quality loss; emissions to \nair and dispersion to water or land is prevented; \nand biomass is optimally cascaded.\nThe four strategies we can use to achieve these \nobjectives are: \n• Narrow flows—Use less : The amount of material \nused or greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the \nmaking of a product or in the delivery of a service \nare decreased. This is through circular design \nor increasing the usage rates of materials and \nproducts. In practice: Sharing and rental models, \nmaterial lightweighting, multifunctional products \nor buildings, energy efficiency, digitisation.\n• Slow flows—Use longer : Resource use is optimised \nas the functional lifetime of goods is extended. \nDurable design, materials and service loops that \nextend life, such as repair and remanufacturing, \nboth contribute to slowing rates of extraction \nand use. In practice: Durable material use, \nmodular design, design for disassembly, repair, \nremanufacturing, refurbishing, renovation, \nremodelling. \n25\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021",

In \npractice: Regenerative material use, renewable \nenergy, regenerative agriculture.\n• Cycle flows—Use again: The reuse of materials \nor products at end-of-life is optimised, facilitating \na circular flow of resources. This is enhanced with \nimproved collection and reprocessing of materials \nand optimal cascading by creating value in each \nstage of reuse. In practice: Design for recyclability \n(both technical and biological), design for \ndisassembly, recycling, waste-to-energy.\nIf we effectively deploy strategies focused on slowing , \nnarrowing , cycling  and regenerating  the flow of \nmaterials, we will ultimately require fewer materials \nto provide for similar needs. Because of this, fewer \nmaterials will be used by the economy, they will have \na longer lifespan and can be reused more effectively \nand with less harm caused to the environment. For our \nCircularity Metric to capture this crucial process, we \nmeasure the share of cycled materials as part of the \ntotal material inputs into a global economy. As such, it \nillustrates the current progress towards achieving the \ncircular economy’s ultimate goal of designing out waste \nthrough the four listed strategies.\nTHE EMISSIONS GAP\nFor a decade, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) has highlighted the Emissions \nGap every year. The Emissions Gap assesses the level \nof GHGs emitted if we continue to plunder along a \nbusiness-as-usual scenario that includes current \nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), compared \nto the level we must emit to stay on track to keep \nrising global temperature to 2-degrees, and ideally \n1.5-degrees. In the 2020 edition of the Report , launched \nin December 2020, seven scenarios are outlined \nspecifying the Gap under different policy settings \n(2010 policies, current policies, Unconditional NDCs, \nConditional NDCs) and under different goals (2-degree \ngoal, a 1.8-degree goal and a 1.5-degree goal). 33\nTHE EMISSIONS GAP IN THE CIRCULARITY \nGAP REPORT\nIt was in 2017 that we at Circle Economy took \ninspiration from the Emissions Gap Report and felt an \nequivalent for the use of materials was needed on a \nglobal stage. Then the Circularity Gap Report was born. \nThe Emissions Gap that is referred to in this Circularity \nGap Report  is defined in reference to a 1.75-degree \ntrajectory to be achieved by 2032 , thereby meeting \nthe goal of staying well below 2-degree of warming as \nspecified in the Paris Agreement. Where the NDCs and \ncurrent policies end, this Emissions Gap begins.\nTHE EMISSIONS GAP 2020\nAccording to the latest Emissions Gap Report , based \non a scenario of current Unconditional NDCs, \nglobal temperatures are estimated to rise by about \n3.2-degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. 34 \nCarbon dioxide emissions are predicted to fall by up to \n7% (between 2% and 12%) compared to 2019 emission \nlevels as a result of the pandemic slowdown. However, \natmospheric concentrations of GHGs continue to rise. \nThis is because the NDCs are ‘woefully inadequate’, \nstates the report. UNEP also looks at ways to bridge \nthe Gap—with the latest report summarising the scale \nof emerging net-zero emissions pledges made by \ncountries and exploring the potential of the lifestyle, \naviation and shipping sectors. \nIt also states that if we were to continue on a business-\nas-usual pathway, emissions could reach 65 billion \ntonnes CO2 equivalents by 2030 35 (see Figure Three \non page 38 for more information). In this scenario, we \nwould be faced with dangerous climate breakdown. \nThe climate policies already in place can deliver a \nreduction of 11 to 13 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalents. \nOf the remaining emissions, previous Circle Economy \nresearch estimated that circular economy strategies \ncould further close the Emissions Gap by about half. 36 \nThis report finds it delivers a huge reduction of 28.8 \nbillion tonnes and closes the Gap by more than 70%.\nTo read more about our methodologies, visit our \nwebsite circularity-gap.world .\nWHERE DOES OUR\nDATA COME FROM?\nOur study draws upon an increasingly broad research stream \nthat makes use of Environmentally-extended Multi-regional \nInput-Output Analysis (EE-MRIOA) to model the potential \nenvironmental impacts and benefits of the circular economy \nfrom a macroeconomic perspective. Relying on the EE-MRIO \ndatabase Exiobase v3.7, our methodology and underlying \nmodel is based on the same equation set of  two other \nprominent studies—Wood et al. (2017) 37 and Donati et al. \n(2020)38—with the exclusion of rebound effects. \nThe key features of our assessment are its life-cycle \nand consumption-based perspective as well as the use \nof modelling blueprints that revolve around changes in \nconsumption patterns (demand), production recipes (supply) \nand adoption rates in the form of either a partial increase, \nreduction or substitution, of products or services. The scope \nand data for our scenarios and interventions (displayed in \nChapter Four as the roadmap) build upon the work of Ivanova \net al. (2020) 39, Vita et al. (2019) 40, Moran et al. (2018) 41 and \nHertwich et al. (2018) 42, among others. \nOur input-output assessment measures the impact of \nchosen interventions and scenarios on the material and \ncarbon footprints of the globe, which we divided into three \ncountry profiles, namely: Grow, Build and Shift. A separate \nmodelling is carried out for quantifying flows of waste and \nsecondary materials based on a ‘light update’ of the hybrid \nExiobase v3.3.17 IOTs. Bringing this information together, \nthe Circularity Gap measures the share of virgin materials \nin the total material consumption, while the Emissions Gap \ngauges how much of the global GHG footprint still needs \nto be reduced in order to stay within the 1.5 and 2-degrees \nemissions pathways set by the IPCC.\nPhoto by Matthew DeVries\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n26\n",

      "content": "THE\nBRID-\nGING\nGAPS\n4\nNow that we have presented the current state of \nthe globe’s emissions and vast resource use, it is \ntime to analyse the findings and suggest a remedy. \nIn this chapter, we explore the transformative \npower of circular economy strategies to ensure \nintelligent material use, tackle overconsumption \nand slash greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They \ngo further than the current policies and national \nclimate pledges dare to go. Moving beyond \nrenewable and efficient energy, they draw from a \ndeeper body of circular interventions;  calling for \nsystemic transformation coupled with behavioural \nchange. Nested within our roadmap are ‘what-if’ \nscenarios, which have been based on strategies \nthat ultimately narrow, slow, regenerate or \ncycle material flows across societal needs and \nwants. They ultimately have a major effect on \nmanaging climate and world resource use, such \nthat the impact trends fall back within planetary \nboundaries. The broader ambition is that these \ndirections facilitate and trigger concerted action \nand the formation of global and local coalitions to \nadvance ideas across sectors, supply chains, cities \nand regions.\nSCENARIOS FOR THE WORLD\nThere is a long history of sketching scenarios to \nreform the global economy, with the Club of Rome’s \nreport, Limits to Growth , in 1972 providing a landmark \nin this tradition. The message of this book still rings \ntrue today: the earth’s resources cannot sustain \ncurrent rates of economic and population growth \nmuch beyond the year 2100. We’ve witnessed the \npublication of scenarios in this field since then. \nThey’ve ranged from considering the near-term and \nincremental change, which is symptomatic of many of \nthe Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), while \nothers take a more transformational approach with an \neye on systemic change. This includes the approach \nour Circularity Gap Reports take. With scenarios rooted \nin the circular economy, there is a clear need for \nurgent transformation of how we produce, design and \nconsume within our economies. \nNO COUNTRY IS FINISHED DEVELOPING \nHow could we not call for transformational and \nsystemic change? Last year, our report posited that \nwhen it comes to reaching the ecologically safe 43 \nand socially just 44 space, all countries are failing. We \nare all developing countries. On the global stage, we \ncontinue to consume too much and to drive climate \nbreakdown with increasing levels of GHG emissions \nfrom our activities. Marking a turning point in 2020, \nthe International Energy Agency’s (IEA) flagship World \nEnergy Outlook  report 45—which typically set the tone \nof the climate debate—laid out an aggressive action \nplan for countries. For the first time, it went beyond \nfocusing on the renewable energy transition and \ncalled for behavioural overhauls across all populations \nthat enjoy access to modern energy. Clearly, from \nproduction to consumption, the alarm is heard: we \nneed to change. \nSOCIAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nOf course, 2020 was a year like no other for many of us. \nAs the pandemic threatened the livelihoods of billions, \ncalls for systemic transformation were everywhere, \nwhile narratives around ‘building back better’ and ‘the \ngreat reset’ ushered in a real sense of opportunity. \nThis time, our responses must match the scale of the \nclimate, social and economic emergency—in a way \nthat reduces global and local inequality and protects \nagainst climate breakdown. Therefore it is imperative \nto add strings to our bow and incorporate social \nand ethical considerations in the circular economy \ntransition. Any successful economic model must meet \nthe needs of the society it serves while responsibly \nstewarding the natural systems upon which it is reliant. \nIt is a matter of striking a harmonious balance between \npeople and planet.  \nIt’s also imperative to remember who will drive the \ncircular transition on the ground: human capital. \nInitially, the circular economy transition is expected \nto be labour-intensive. This is because the core pillars \nbehind preserving a material’s maximum value, for \nas long as possible (reuse, repair, remanufacture and \nrecycling), hinge on processes that typically require \nmore labour than in the linear economy where \nresources are often wasted and incinerated 4647. With \nthe introduction of new design strategies, production \nprocesses and business models, the type of work that \nwill be undertaken will be reshaped, thereby creating \nnew jobs, transforming existing ones and phasing \nout others. This change will require skills from across \nthe spectrum, where we need to pay equal attention \nto practically- and theoretically-skilled workers and \nensure that workers are protected and don’t fall foul \nto the same explotiations as in the linear economy. A \ncircular economy transition that is mindful of social \nand ethical issues is one for which we should all strive.\nOur roadmap to a well  \nbelow 2-degree world\nPhoto by Edho Fitrah \n29\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021",

      "content": "SOCIETY CENTRAL, RESOURCE SMART, \nCLIMATE-SAFE SCENARIOS\nIn creating a roadmap to a well below 2-degree reality \nfor the globe, its complexity needs to be taken into \naccount. The nine planetary boundaries framework, \nwhich includes biodiversity loss, climate change and \nland system change 48, provides guidance here. In our \nanalysis, however, we spotlight two aspects in one \nstrategy: climate mitigation through the intelligent \nmanagement of the globe’s resources. In this way, \nwe don’t explicitly engage with the other planetary \nboundaries, but this allows us to focus on scenarios  \nthat can point us in the direction of a safe and just \nspace. We use the Circularity Gap and the Emissions  \nGap as goals to guide us in building our scenarios for  \nthe roadmap.\nTo construct our roadmap and the scenarios it holds, \nwe look at the seven societal needs and wants (see page \n17). Taking this consumption approach, we are able to \nexamine ethical considerations and trade-offs that could \npotentially arise in the transition to circularity. We are \naware that resources are increasingly used to not only \nsatisfy societal needs, but also wants. 49 Consider this: \nalthough a healthy diet requires 2,000 kcal per day for  \na typical female, the intake in some countries may be  \nfar higher, while malnutrition persists in others.  \nThe more calorie intensive diets could consist of  \nout-of-season, imported foods that have travelled \nacross the globe, or high levels of animal protein.  \nCalling to reduce consumption here may be appropriate \nand even ethical, but less so in cases where access to \nbasic nutritious food is limited. The circular economy \nis also about achieving a structural and cultural shift \nwhere we can all satisfy universal needs—so there \nare important differences to take into consideration. \nIn being a means to an end of a safe and just space, \nthe circular economy must consider that different \napproaches or tactics must prevail in different contexts \nto ensure local needs are met and that a reduction in \noverconsumption, for example, is encouraged. We apply \nthis thinking in Chapter Six and Seven when we consider \nour three country profiles: Build, Grow and Shift.\nIt’s worth noting that the scenarios within our roadmap \nare ‘what-if’ scenarios: they serve as an ambitious \nexploration of a potential path forward and sketch \nwhich type of interventions and levers are most \nimpactful. They are not, however, grounded in political \nrealities. They do provide a qualitative assessment \nof the implementation timeframe, but they are not \nquantitatively modelled year-by-year.\nA POWERFUL STARTING POINT: THE NDCS\nFollowing three decades—since the Earth Summit \nin Rio de Janeiro in 1992—of global coordination \non climate change, the majority of nations have \nput forward plans to get our planet back on a safe \ntrajectory: the NDCs. These targets are not static, \none-off commitments; they are long-term and require \ninvestment, time and tracking. However, multiple \nreports and progress-checks 50 have found that these \nplans will not only probably be missed but that they—\neven at the onset—never went far enough to keep us \non a below 2-degree path. This highlights the need \nfor interventions that go far beyond the NDCs, and \nencapsulates the drivers behind our research: the \ntransition to a circular economy can contribute further \nto climate change mitigation than the strategies \ncountries are currently employing. \nFor this reason, we have excluded circular \ninterventions that were commonly mentioned in \ncountries’ first NDCs. While only the transition to \nrenewable energy was mentioned in the majority (57%) \nof NDCs—albeit at varying degrees of detail—other \ninterventions such as ‘energy efficient appliances’ \nand ‘shift to public transport’ also appeared fairly \nfrequently. For this reason, none of these strategies \nhave been directly included in our analysis.  \nBy prioritising in this way, we hope to demonstrate  \nthe additional potential and impact our scenarios will \nhave in keeping us on track to meet the goals of the \nParis Agreement. \n \nWHY\nIn developing circular interventions to transform  \nhow we fulfil our societal needs and wants, we  \nuse the four circular flow strategies as a base (see  25).  \nBut how do they tackle both GHG emissions and  \nmaterial footprints?\nNARROW,\nBy minimising the overall material inputs into an economy, \nthe emissions present in resources and, therefore, end \nproducts will be lower. This can be strengthened if priority \nis given to the flows with the highest embodied emissions.\nREGENERATE,\nIn using regenerative resources, the high levels of \nemissions in fossil fuels and unsustainable biomass  \nare cut from the economy\nSLOW,\nIn extending the functional lifetime of resources,  \nthe emissions attached to individual material flows  \nare spread out and therefore minimised over time.\nCYCLE?\nDepending on the energy used and emissions released \nduring cycling, this strategy has the potential to  \neliminate embodied emissions from inputs.\n31\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n30\n",

      "content": "HOUSING\nHousing leads the way in guzzling resources and \nproducing emissions to satisfy our need for shelter. \nWhen it comes to the environmental impact of a sector \nas economically and socially significant as Housing, \nwe must use less, by narrowing flows. This can be \nachieved through ultimately building fewer, but \nbetter, new houses and multi-occupancy dwellings, \nto reduce overall floor space and optimise resource \nefficiency. However, before we build new buildings,  \nwe should prioritise extending the lifetime of \nexisting stock.\nCore interventions include banning building with \nvirgin materials  and simultaneously introducing \npolicies to cap residential stock expansion in line \nwith available Construction and Demolition Waste \n(C&DW). This strategy assumes all C&DW is diverted \nas a secondary material for residential construction, \nbut only half is fit for purpose (high uncertainty). It \nalso factors in the rate of demolition as a determinant \nof material flow volumes. In short, new construction \nis constrained by the secondary materials that \nbecome available.\nIn slowing flows, more co-housing, increased \nrenovation, refurbishment, modular design  that can \neasily adapt to needs over time is needed, and  \nre-occupancy of underused and disused buildings  \nto meet housing demand within global stock limits. \nOptimising flexible and multi-functional space  \nfor non-residential purposes also frees up existing \nstock for (redesignation as) housing. In addition, the \nreduction in total floorspace delivers proportional \nsavings on heating and cooling; while this is enhanced \nwith avenues to cut energy consumption, such as lower \nroom temperatures, smart metering and improved \nthermal insulation. Retrofitting existing housing \nstock will both slow flows by extending the lifespan \nand in some cases cycle flows through reuse of \nmaterials in renovation and refurbishment on-site (as \ndoes the specification of recycled or circular materials \nin general construction).\nNature-inspired solutions can also lower material \nand energy demand by narrowing  and regenerating  \nflows. Low-energy approaches such as Passivhaus \ndesign (minimising requirements for mechanical space \nheating, cooling and ventilation) can narrow flows, \nwhile applying renewable technologies  such as solar \nphotovoltaic or thermal, air-source and geothermal \nheat pumps , can regenerate flows and shrink the \ncarbon footprint of a property. The use of low-carbon \nconstruction materials, lightweighting and local \nsourcing all help to cut embodied energy. Natural  \nor renewable building materials , such as wood, \nstraw and hemp, help regenerate flows as well.  \nGreen roofs and living walls are all examples of \ninterventions with regenerative benefits, at least in \nterms of thermal performance, water management, \nbiodiversity and air quality.\nFinally, other impactful interventions that can cycle \nflows include modern methods of construction  \nsuch as modular and offsite design, plus design for \nmanufacture and assembly . As well as carrying the \npotential for deconstruction, relocation and reuse \nof elements (or even whole buildings), factory-built \noptions boost resource efficiency in production and \nperformance.\nNUTRITION\nIn such a resource- and emissions-intensive need, \ntackling food shortages and scarcity starts first with \noptimising how we use the food we already have at our \ndisposal, before looking to increase production. Here, \nthe notion of ‘sustainable biomass’—which is produced \nand sourced sustainably (meaning carbon-neutral) 51, \nand therefore circular—is also very important as food \nconstitutes a large proportion of it globally.\nCutting excess consumption  is a critical means to \nnarrow flows. Interventions around food sufficiency—\nfor instance, via reductions in per capita caloric and \nprotein daily uptake rates in Shift countries, bringing \nthem down to match Grow country levels (see more \non page 50)—can also result in secondary benefits \nsuch as less packaging. In our roadmap, slashing \nexcess consumption implies keeping caloric supply \n(not consumption) under 3,000 kcal per person, per \nday, reducing packaging in the food supply chain \nby 55%, and reducing food waste (household) and \nlosses (supply chain).  Further narrow interventions \ninclude footprint-per-calorie reductions  which \ncan be achieved through changes in diet ; largely \nthe uptake of vegan  and healthier  options. Given a \nfocus on constant caloric and protein intake, a move \naway from foods with low nutritional value, such as \nsugary beverages and refined, heavily processed food \ncan be impactful. Unprocessed food  is championed, \nalongside an ongoing decrease in consumption of all \nmeat, fish and dairy, with a target of 100% eradication \nof unhealthy high-sugar, high-salt products.\nSustainable food production  represents another \nsignificant avenue. Fresh, regional, local and seasonal \noptions on the menu mean less need for hot-housing \nvegetables, which equates to a reduction in fuel \ninputs, plus fewer food miles and lower transportation \nimpacts. Urban, organic  and precision farming  \nmodels would also eliminate synthetic fertiliser use.\nBacked by carbon-neutral biomass certification, \nsubstituting food waste and losses for fodder crops  \nwill support growth of secondary markets, helping to \ncycle flows.\nImprovements to food preparation resources and \npractices would bring benefits to public health, as well \nas energy consumption. Key interventions include \nthe replacement of polluting traditional biomass and \nblack-carbon-producing stoves with clean cooking  \napparatuses, including advanced solar-electric stoves, \nthat would regenerate flows.\nMOBILITY\nWith its mammoth footprint, Mobility is commonly \nassociated in the minds of both policymakers and the \npublic with GHG emissions reduction. From driving to \nflying, opportunities for change are plentiful.\nAs evidenced during the global pandemic’s regional \nlockdowns, the obvious way to narrow flows is simply \nto reduce travel . This reduction can be achieved \nthrough a range of interventions, including the \nprovision of regional and local hubs, shared and \nvirtual offices, telecommuting  and working from \nhome. The optimisation of supply chain logistics also \nrepresents an opportunity for multiple resource-\nefficiency wins in terms of waste minimisation,  \ncargo miles  and infrastructure cost . Vehicle design \nimprovements  are another more incremental way to \nnarrow flows, with lightweighting and smaller sizes  \nof mobility vehicles such as cars and scooters,  \nresulting in a reduced requirement for steel \nand aluminium production, as well as lower fuel \nconsumption and embodied energy. Autonomous \nvehicles  (driverless cars), as well as electric bicycles  \npromise Mass-Carbon savings, too. When it comes to \nprioritising durable design  and material selection, \nplus optimising repairability and maximising \nmaintenance , we can also slow flows, thereby \nextending the lifetime of vehicles.\nAs well as better vehicles, better utilisation of all \nvehicles  will further narrow flows. With personal \nvehicle ownership no longer the dream it once seemed, \ninterventions include shared mobility , via car clubs \nand pools, ride-sharing , as well as public transport , \nwith park-and-ride provision to cut fuel consumption 52.\nFinally, optimising end-of-life vehicle management  \nis critical to cycle flows, with the recycling of metal and \nplastic components, and the use of recycled material, \non the rise. \nCOMMUNICATION\nEfficient design and use of communication \nequipment , especially by way of digitalisation , can \nnarrow flows. Consider the large reduction in printed \nmaterials as the trends towards e-books and online \nnews platforms gained ground. Interventions include \nthe sharing of equipment and tools , plus cloud \ncomputing services, which help avoid a trade-off \nin terms of proliferation of impacts from personal \ncomputing and mobile electronic devices. Simply \nbuying smaller and lighter  laptops instead of  \ndesktop computers with LCD monitors can mean \nresource consumption is reduced and resource \nefficiency enhanced.\n33\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n32\n",

Tangible interventions include: increasing \ndigitisation  to reduce paper use; not making textiles \nfrom animals ; aiming to eradicate single-use plastic ; \noptimising usage of electronics  to minimise e-waste; \nspecifying only eco-labelled responsibly-sourced \ntimber furniture ; and prioritising local purchasing \nand sourcing . \nIn slowing flows, which revolves around the design of \ndurable consumer products , interventions include \nintroducing and encouraging repair, maintenance, \nsharing, re-manufacturing  and take-back \nprogrammes for textiles, appliances, furniture  \nand machinery .

This section \nhighlights the extent to which our roadmap \n(presented in Chapter Four) is able to mitigate \nclimate breakdown and curb material use globally:  \nin other words how effective they are in  \nMass-Carbon terms. This chapter also showcases \nsome of the dominant climate mitigation  \nnarratives out there: an urgent timeframe and  \na clear temperature goal. \nNO ROOM FOR BUSINESS-AS-USUAL \nMaterial extraction has fuelled economic progress since \nthe Industrial Revolution, at the same time causing \nhuman-made greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Over \nthe last five decades, the global extraction of materials \nmore than tripled, from 26.7 billion tonnes in 1970, to \n92.1 billion tonnes in 2017. 53 And as we revealed in our \n2020 report, more than 100 billion tonnes of materials \nnow enter our economy. Material use is accelerating; \nand with this comes increased GHG emissions—now \ntotaling 59.1 billion tonnes. 54\nExceptionally in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic resulted \nin worldwide lockdowns. As people were restricted \nto their homes, a hefty dent was made in the annual \nemissions bill: at the lowest point global CO 2 was 7% \n(between 2% and 12%) lower than in 2019. 55 This was the \nlowest level since 2010. However, little has been done \nto prevent a rapid rebound in emissions as countries \nbegan opening up after both the first and second wave. \nTo put emissions into a structural decline, large shifts \nin government policies will have to take place. The \nEmissions Gap Report  2020 found that a green pandemic \nrecovery 56 could shave 25% off the emissions we would \nsee with the current pre-covid policies in place. And \nnow we are armed with new knowledge: faced with \nthe necessary urgency we can rapidly change our \nbehaviours almost overnight. And, ultimately, climate \nbreakdown will be the biggest global health threat  \nof the century. 57\nMaking our economies more resource-efficient will, \nin turn, reduce GHG emissions along the value-\nchain— from the mines from which raw materials are \nsourced and the fields in which produce is grown, to \nmanufacturing and retail via last-mile logistics.  \nThis exponential potential for a global reset crosses all \nborders which demarcate national climate commitments \nand favours intensifying cooperation along supply \nchains, thereby closing local material cycles. \nThe transformational  \nimpact of circularity\nPhoto by Mike Erskine \n37\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021",

Assuming emissions remained equal for  \n2018-2020, this budget has been depleted by 167 billion tonnes \nCO 2 equivalents—leaving 633 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalents \nremaining. At our current annual rate of emissions, it would \ntake us just a little over a decade to blaze through this 633 \nbillion tonnes budget; highlighting how urgent an initial \ncurtailing of emissions is. The sooner we begin, the more time \nwe have to reach the ultimate goal—net-zero. \nFigure Three  shows the trajectory that could be \nachieved if our roadmap is implemented and backed \nby strong action that honours NDC commitments. \nUnder a ‘current policies’ scenario we will likely reach \n60 billion tonnes of GHG emissions by 2030. With \nthe adoption of the (unconditional) NDCs this will go \ndown to 56 billion tonnes by 2030. Implementation \nof the interventions we suggest will bring this down \nfurther to reach 33.2 billion tonnes of CO 2eq by 2030, \nwhich is on trajectory towards net-zero by 2044. In \nshort, between business-as-usual and our scenario by \n2030, the NDCs could 15% of the solution whereas our \nroadmap can deliver the additional 85% needed. This \nillustrates, again, the transformational character of the \ninterventions proposed in this report.\nOur global carbon budget 58 in 2018—the cumulative \namount of CO 2eq emissions permitted over a period of \ntime to stay within a certain temperature threshold—\nto keep warming well below 2-degrees has already \ndepleted by 21%. * At our current annual rate of \nemissions, it would take us just a little over a decade to \nblaze through the remaining  budget—highlighting the \nurgency of an initial curtailing of emissions. The sooner \nwe begin, the more time we have to reach the ultimate \ngoal—net-zero. \nIf we assume that emissions will decline from 2021 \nonwards at a linear rate, we are given the gift of more \ntime. Staying within the desired well below 2-degree \nlimit will be possible in this scenario if we reach net-\nzero emissions by 2044, upping the previous deadline \nby more than a decade. To realise this scenario, though, \nwe must implement all NDC pledgesand all proposed \ncircular strategies in our roadmap by 2030—and then \ncarry that momentum forward until 2044. \nIS A FULLY CIRCULAR  \nECONOMY POSSIBLE?\nHuge dynamics at play across the globe \nrepresent barriers to us closing the \nCircularity Gap to the same extent we can \nclose the Emissions Gap. These include:\nStock build-up and operation.  \nCountries are continually investing in \nnew buildings and infrastructure, such \nas to provide Mobility and Housing, as \nwell as renewable energy. This stock \nbuild-up is not inherently bad; many \ncountries need to invest to ensure that \nthe local populations have access to basic \nservices, particularly in Build and Grow \ncountries (Chapter Six), as well as build-\nup infrastructure globally to support \nrenewable energy generation, distribution \nand storage capacity. These resources \nwould remain locked away and not \navailable for cycling, and therefore weigh \ndown the Circularity Metric.\nMaterial quality loss.  Even in an ideal \ncircular system, some primary resource \nextraction would still exist. This is \nbecause there is always a loss of material \nquantity or quality in the process of \ncycling, which we need to compensate \nfor by adding new virgin materials either \ndirectly or in the form of energy.  \n56\n31\n20442018\n7\n1900-2050\nCARBON TRAJECTORIES\nCurrent trajectory  80Gt\nThe Earth is 3 to 6-degrees warmer\nCurrent trajectory  177Gt\nBy 2050\nmass trajectory\nprojected mass trajectory\nmass projection range\nNDC trajectory  56Gt\nThe Earth is 2 to 3-degrees warmer\nNDC + CE trajectory: The Earth \nis only 1.75-degrees warmer\nCarbon dioxide equivalent \nemissions in billion tonnes \n(Gt CO 2 eq)\nCARBON\n92\n7\nMaterial extraction\nin billion tonnes (Gt)\nMASS\n1900\n28\n1970\n27\n2032\ncarbon trajectory\nprojected carbon trajectory\ncarbon projection range\n 56\n31\n20442018\n7\n1900-2050\nCARBON TRAJECTORIES\nCurrent trajectory  80Gt\nThe Earth is 3 to 6-degrees warmer\nCurrent trajectory  177Gt\nBy 2050\nmass trajectory\nprojected mass trajectory\nmass projection range\nNDC trajectory  56Gt\nThe Earth is 2 to 3-degrees warmer\nNDC + CE trajectory: The Earth \nis only 1.75-degrees warmer\nCarbon dioxide equivalent \nemissions in billion tonnes \n(Gt CO 2 eq)\nCARBON\n92\n7\nMaterial extraction\nin billion tonnes (Gt)\nMASS\n1900\n28\n1970\n27\n2032\ncarbon trajectory\nprojected carbon trajectory\ncarbon projection range\nEven if countries meet all the targets laid out in NDCs—\nmost of which have been deemed insufficient, highly \ninsufficient or critically insufficient 59—emissions will \nnot drop, but rather stabilise up to 2030.

      "content": "Figure xx shows the impact of our interventions on the \nCircularity and Emissions Gaps\nTHE SOLUTION SPACE SUMMARISED\nFigure Four on the next page shows how our roadmap \n21 interventions across six scenarios—one for each \nof the six societal needs we model—can mitigate \nclimate impact by curbing GHG emissions. The \nroadmap sketches interventions that move beyond \nincremental action and provides solutions that will \nrequire behavioural change (dietary shifts towards \nless meat consumption, for example) and the \nadoption of state-of-the-art technologies in industry \nto mitigate emissions in hard to abate sectors (such \nas steel manufacturing). It illustrates how continued \nglobalisation can benefit from the uptake of digital \nsolutions. The combined interventions showcase the \nmitigation potential that begins where the current \ncountry pledges end; illustrating the additional impact \nour interventions can bring to the NDCs. In short, the \ninterventions provide input for a more profound and \nfundamental transformation than the more current \npathways that make up the vast majority of NDCs. \nFor each intervention, Figure Four shows its \npotential to reduce GHG emissions as the width of \nthe intervention ‘box’, and the material footprint \nreduction by the height of the box. The image shows \nthe contribution of each intervention separately, as \nwell as for all interventions combined. What is visible \nis that some interventions overlap, which means that \nthe total effect when we consider certain interventions \noverlapping is significantly less than when all individual \ninterventions are combined, yet ignoring the overlap. \nThis is because some interventions, when combined, \nwill partially cancel each other out. For example, in \n‘Reduce floor space’, we also reduce the volumes \nof construction and demolition waste (C&DW) that \nbecome available for recycling and repurposing. \nAnother example is the overlap between various  \nsmart transport solutions (‘Reduce travel’,  \n‘Circular vehicles’, for example), whose impact is \nmodelled to narrow the footprint of Mobility.  \nThe absolute impact of lightweighting the global \ncar fleet in ‘Vehicle design improvements’ is directly \nmoderated by the size of the said fleet, which in turn \nis reduced by, for instance, car sharing. This dynamic \nbetween interventions and the extent of their overlaps \nis visually depicted by the boxes.\nThe Figure shows the sheer difference in the \nemissions- and material-reduction power between \ninterventions. Echoing our findings from the \nemissions x-ray presented in Chapter Two, it’s clear \nthat the societal needs that currently generate most \nemissions—Housing, Mobility and Nutrition—also \nshow the biggest need, and in fact, opportunity, to \nreduce impacts.  \nTogether, the combined interventions can almost \ndouble the current global Circularity Metric of 8.6%, \nbringing it to 17%. In temperature terms, we can stay \nbelow a 2-degrees warming scenario if we implement \nall segments of the roadmap, as well as conditional \nand unconditional NDCs by 2032, and then continue \ndecreasing emissions at more or less the same pace to \nreach net-zero by 2050. \nINTERVENTIONS\nVORTEX\nFigure Four shows the impact of our interventions  \non the Circularity and Emissions Gaps\n-0.7\nINTERVENTIONS\nVORTEX\n \n \nSustainable\nfoodproduction\nReducetravel\nImprove\nvehicle\nutilisation\nResource\neﬃcient\nconstruction\n‘Natural’housingsolutions\nCleancooking\nstoves\nReduction\nexcess\nconsumption\n1.8°C\n3.2°C\nResource \neﬃcient\nhousing\n-0\n.9\nCircular\nvehicles\nVehicles\ndurability\nVehicles\ndesign\nimprovements\nEﬃcient\ndesign\n& use\nof ICTs\nCircular\nhealthcaresystem\nDurable\nconsumerproducts\nEﬃcient design\n& use of\nconsumerproducts\nCircularconsumables\nChemi-cals free\n-3.4\n-3.4\n-6.5\n-1.3\n-1.5\n-1.8\n-2.4-1\n-1.3\n-1.2\n-1\n-0.3-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.5\n-0.4\nCircular \nconstruction materials\n-1.1\n-3.5\n-3.4\nIncreasehousing\ndurability\nReduceﬂoor\nspace\n-2.1\n-3.2\n-5.3\n-8.4\n-4\n-3.1\n-0 .5\n-2.5\n-1.2\n-2.2\n-3.3\n-1.6\n-2\n-0 .8\n-0.3\n-0.3\n-0\n.3\n-2.1\n-2\nHealthy \ndiet\n \n         C\nO\nN\nS\nU\nM\nA\nB\nL\nE\nINTERVENTIONS \nVORTEX\n \n \nSustainable\nfoodproduction\nReducetravel\nImprove\nvehicle\nutilisation\nResource\nefficient\nconstruction\n‘Natural’housingsolutions\nCleancooking\nstoves\nReduction\nexcess\nconsumption\n-3.1°C\n-1.8°C\nResource \nefficient\nhousing\nCircular\nvehicles\nVehicles\ndurability\nVehicles\ndesign\nimprovements\nEfficient\ndesign\n& use\nof ICTs\nCircular\nhealthcaresystem\nDurable\nconsumerproducts\nEfficient design\n& use of\nconsumerproducts\nCircularconsumables\nChemi-cals free\nHealthy \ndiet\n \n \nWIDTH \nexpresses the emissions\nreduction  in GtCO 2eq\nHEIGHT \nexpresses the material \nmass  reduction in Gt\nCOLOUR\nrepresents a societal need:\nMOBILITY CONSUMABLES\nHEALTHCARE COMMUNICATIONS\nNUTRITION HOUSING\nCircular \nconstruction materials\nIncreasehousing\ndurability\nReducefloor\nspace\n-3.1°C-1.8°C\nTEMPERATURE\ntotal reduction in global \ntemperature increase \nby 2050\nCOLOUR\nrepresents a societal need:\nMOBILITY\nCONSUMABLES\nHEALTHCARE\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nNUTRITION\nHOUSING\n1.8°C3.2°C\nTEMPERATURE\ntotal mitigation of expected global\ntemperature increase by 2050\n \nWIDTH\nexpresses the emissions\nreduction in Gt CO2 eq\nHEIGHT \nexpresses the materialmass\n reduction in Gt\n-∞\n40\n",

      "content": "of both interventions (slow and cycle); both have a \ncrucial role to play in closing the Circularity Gap, which \ncan only occur if all demand for construction materials \nis met by secondary materials, which is technically \nchallenging. (For more information refer to the text \nbox on page 39).\nSYNERGISTIC INTERVENTIONS\nThe reality is that the fastest route to achieving climate \nchange mitigation hinges on substantial reductions in \nour overall use of materials. In particular, those that \nhave the highest embodied emissions—namely, fossil \nfuels and sustainably produced biomass. The logic \nfollows that interventions that focus on using less have \na substantial impact on closing both the Gaps. \nHousing  leads as the societal need with the most \nsynergistic potential. There are a few main reasons \nbehind this. Firstly, it has a gigantic contribution to \nresource extraction. Secondly, it makes abundant use \nof carbon-intensive materials such as cement and \nsteel, heavily produces direct emissions from space \nheating and cooling (which can be diminished by a \nshift to renewable energy) and lastly is dominant in \nthe generation of waste and potential for secondary \nmaterial supply in the form of C&DW. With circular \nstrategies, 9.5 billion tonnes of C&DW could be \ndiverted from landfill. This is over four times the total \nglobal municipal solid waste (2.1 billion tonnes). The \ninterventions we applied to the second most impactful \nsocietal need of Nutrition  appear to have a slightly \ngreater impact on the Emissions Gap. This is not \nentirely surprising, as most of the sector is related to \necological, rather than technical, cycling (biomass). \nMoving to clean cooking stoves and healthy diets has a \nsofter impact, while reducing excess consumption and \nsustainable farming stand out for their strong effect on \nboth the Circularity and Emissions Gap, respectively.\nThe remaining societal needs Health, Communication  \nand Consumables  have a noticeably lower impact on \nclosing both Gaps. Consumables scenarios, defined by \nefficient product design and use, were less impactful \non the whole, having a higher relative impact on \ncircularity than emissions. As noted, the only product \ngroup to have a significant influence on both Gaps \nwas that of chemicals and chemical products—while \nmore common consumer items, from furniture and \nappliances to paper and plastic, had a more modest \neffect. However, this doesn’t mean these categories \nshould be ignored, as these interventions cover the \nproducts that final consumers can most easily engage \nwith. Circular consumption models will inevitably \nhave knock-on effects at a systems level, in addition \nto being within the reach of individuals to drive the \nchange. However, in tailoring this treatment plan to \ncountry profiles we will move forward by focussing on \nNutrition, Mobility, Housing  and the enabling space \nof waste management .\nGLOBAL EMISSIONS SLASHED BY 39% \nFrom a global warming perspective—and with the \naim of closing the Emissions Gap—our circular \nscenarios have the potential to cut 39% of total \nglobal emissions . Breaking this down, we see that the \nsocietal need for Mobility  is the largest contributing \n‘consumption category’, although Housing  and \nNutrition  also have huge mitigation power.\nAbout two-thirds of the reduction in emissions is \nattributable to our interventions—detailed on pages \n32 to 34 and in Figure Four—that tackle supply chain \nemissions (a reduction of 14.8 billion tonnes). These \nalso serve to reduce overall consumption, for example \nthrough shared mobility concepts, or by reducing \noverall floorspace and increasing the durability of \nbuildings. Only one-third of the emissions reduction is \nlinked to reducing the direct emissions from Mobility  \n(emissions released while driving) by reducing travel, \nlowering heating and cooling needs within Housing  by \napplying green building strategies, for example, and \navoiding all emissions associated with human activities \nin Nutrition  that take place on agricultural land, \nforested land, wetland or peatland, such as cutting \ndown forests or ploughing grasslands; land use, land-\nuse change and forestry (LULUCF).\nDespite the overarching impact of reducing global \nsupply chain emissions as a whole, we see that the \nmitigation potential of each societal need and want \nvaries. In providing Housing  to the global population, \n82% of emission reductions are related to the material \nside—the supply chain of construction materials—\nand to energy use in commercial and industrial \nbuildings. Just 18% of the mitigation potential lies \nenergy combustion for residential heating and hot \nwater. Meanwhile, for Mobility , the majority (52%) of \nemission reductions relate to the supply chain and \ncommercial fleet operation: design and manufacturing \ninterventions, such as integrating circularity into \nvehicle design, as opposed to diffused emissions  \nfrom driving. \nFor Nutrition , over 70% of mitigation potential can \nbe attributed to how we use and value our land: \nLULUCF. The remaining 27% of emissions come \nfrom the supply chain—such as transporting crops \nfrom farms to traders. Our interventions can reduce \nLULUCF emissions by 75%—from 4.1 billion tonnes \nto only 1 billion tonne (high uncertainty). As global \npopulations and appetites grow, more land is needed \nfor crop cultivation—especially for livestock feed—\nand pasture land for raising animals. This drives \ndeforestation which is hugely polluting, devastating \nfor local biodiversity, and cuts the natural carbon \nabsorption capacity of forests. Avoiding deforestation \nwith sustainably farmed or managed biomass is a \nhuge enabler, as our Nutrition  scenario denotes, as \nis shrinking the footprint of our diets by reducing our \nconsumption of meat proteins.\nRESOURCE EXTRACTION DOWN BY 28%\nWhen taking a mass perspective, clearly the most \nimpactful interventions for closing the Circularity Gap \ncome from Housing , but also Nutrition . Although \nit is a less impactful spatial need, Consumables ’ \nintervention ‘Eliminate toxins and pollutants’ scored \nan interesting contribution to the Circularity Gap. \nIn general, for Consumables , it seems that the only \nproduct category that can have sizable impacts on \nemissions and circularity is related to the use of \nchemicals and chemical products.\nThe mitigation potential for Housing  largely stems \nfrom the diversion of C&DW. Of all global waste in \n2016, a massive 67.6% came from stocks: largely \ndemolished buildings, infrastructure (and machinery, \nequipment and vehicles to a smaller extent). With the \nglobal average recovery rates of C&DW only standing \nat 35%, there is huge potential for impact here. As \na result, fewer virgin materials would need to be \nextracted, which would alleviate the environmental \nimpacts of mining and processing to produce materials \nsuch as cement and steel for construction. A further \nbenefit would be that the amount of cycled materials in \nthe economy would rise.\nHowever there are limitations to how much we can \nclose the Gap—primarily due to the non-synergistic \nrelationship between some interventions. Some \nthat focus on designing products and infrastructure \nto last means that stocks last longer, resulting in a \nfurther locking up of materials, which diminishes their \npotential for cycling. In the case of durable housing, \nthis has a huge impact on the Circularity Gap, given the \nlarge critical mass of construction materials. We found \na similar pattern for Consumables  and Mobility : while \ndurability interventions that extend product lifetime \ncan slash material use by 2.5 billion tonnes, they also \nreduce the cycling potential of these goods, appearing \nless ‘circular’ in our assessment than they actually \nwould be in reality. This doesn’t negate the relevance \n43\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n42\n",

This report has now shown the massive \npotential of circular strategies to deliver at a \nglobal level. However, to influence the massive \ndecisions that will impact our climate future for \ngenerations to come and see real-life results, \nthe global roadmap must be tailored to national \npathways. This chapter builds on the country \nprofiles introduced in the Circularity Gap Report \n2020 ; whilst recognising that no single country \ncan ever be a perfect match for all the criteria of \nany one group, it is important to join the dots of \nour understanding. In this chapter, we consider \nthe high-impact areas of Nutrition, Housing \nand Mobility, plus the enabling role of waste \nmanagement in three distinct country profiles—so \ndemonstrating the nuances of implementing our \nroadmap for a well below 2-degree world,  \nin practice. \nDIFFERENT COUNTRIES, COMMON NEEDS\nDespite clear divergences between countries, we can \nstill discern which circular economy interventions will \nbe most suitable in certain contexts based on clear \ncommon needs and structural parallels. In our 2020 \nanalysis, we took 176 countries and scored them \non their social performance 60 and their ecological \nfootprint 61 to assess how far they were from the end \ngoal: a socially just and ecologically safe space. Our \noverarching finding was illuminating: no country \nresides within a safe and just space today. Some \ncountries are close, others are far away; each starts \nfrom a different point on the map, but all have a \ndistance to go. The position of each country in this \nanalysis helps us form the three broad country \nprofiles, which may exhibit some overlaps but overall \nallow us to highlight key common themes that are \ncentral to development pathways.\nA key point here is severe carbon inequality at present \nand how it has driven our world into the midst of a \nclimate emergency. Nearly half (48%) of cumulative \nCO2 emissions over the last quarter century can be \nattributed to just the richest 10% of the globe, whilst \nthe poorest 50% were responsible for only 7%. 62 In \nthe past decades, our tight global carbon budget has \nbeen lavished on feeding the consumption of the rich \nwhile failing to lift the majority of the global population \nout of poverty. And in a cruel irony, the emissions \ninequality also has another side: lower-income nations \nwho contribute the fewest emissions are also most \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate breakdown. 63 \nThe 2000s have seen a record number of natural \ndisasters, rising sea levels and extreme weather \nevents—all of which are connected to climate change \nand disproportionately impact lower-income nations. 64\nAside from the statistics presented in the table on page \n49, which clearly illustrates the physical, social and \neconomic dimensions of the country profiles, it’s also \nworth considering the emissions and material footprint \nof each profile. This helps us tailor their diagnoses and \nprovide insights into how different country profiles can \nreduce the material and emissions footprint of their \nNutrition, Housing, Mobility and waste management \nneeds. It is clear that leveraging the climate change \nmitigation potential of a circular economy in Build \ncountries means something different from doing so  \nin a Grow or a Shift country. \nCountry profile roadmaps\nPhoto by Tembela Bohle \n45\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021",

All figures are in negative billion tonnes (Gt).\nBUILD\nA low rate of material consumption per capita means \nBuild countries currently transgress few planetary \nboundaries, if any at all. They are responsible for the \nproduction of just 17% of global emissions and 19% \nof global resources in absolute terms, despite making \nup 48% of the global population. But these countries \nare struggling to meet their basic needs, including \nHuman Development Index (HDI) indicators such as \neducation and healthcare. They have biomass-oriented \neconomies and are resource-rich, yet are net importers \nof fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals  \nin the form of finished and semi-finished products.  \nAs they continue to build their more basic \ninfrastructure, Build countries have a uniqueposition \nin moving toward closing both the Circularity and \nEmissions Gaps. \nWhen assessing the potential of Chapter Four’s \ninterventions, Figure Five shows that Housing and \nNutrition have the largest impact in Build countries. As \nBuild countries blaze ahead on improving the quality \nof life for their populations, four pathways in particular \ncan aid the transition to a circular future that can also \nsupport limiting warming to well below 2-degrees. \nThese relate to reforming agricultural practices away \nfrom monocropping and deforestation, applying \ncircular thinking across their necessary construction, \nensuring infrastructure for distributed and accessible \nmobility solutions in growing cities and combining \ninformal and formal waste management infrastructure. \nThe Build profile is most relevant to countries \nin Sub-Saharan Africa, plus some small \nisland states and Asian countries.

So, despite high HDI scores and comfortable \nlifestyles, these countries have a way to go to limit \ntheir consumption in line with our planet’s resources. \nFigure Five  guides us in narrowing our focus for impact, \nand demonstrates how high impact Shift countries \nare. They are also highly responsible for reducing \nglobal emissions, particularly from an historical \nperspective, and are under pressure to do so—fast. \nIn the high-impact areas of Nutrition, Mobility and \nHousing, Shift countries need to, first and foremost, \ntake responsibility and reduce their consumption \nby integrating circular strategies across the board: \nfrom ownership to sharing models; to making the \nmost of their goods—from buildings to vehicles—\nbefore, during and after their functional lifetimes \nand optimising how waste is valorised in the already \nmature waste management systems. To get there,  \nthey must mobilise all the technologies and funds  \nthat they have at their disposal. \nThe Shift profile fits best with the  \nhigher-income countries in the global North, \nin the Middle East and on the Australian \ncontinent. The larger ones are the United \nStates of America, Japan, Argentina and \nmember countries of the European Union.\nThe Grow profile is most relevant to countries \nin Latin America and Northern Africa, as well as \nthose with an economy in transition in Eastern \nEurope, the Caucasus and Central Asia, plus \nlarger Asian countries. The largest countries in \nthis group are China, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, \nVietnam and Egypt.\nGROW\nGrow countries are manufacturing hubs, hosting \nan expanding industrial sector and leading the way \nwhen it comes to building and economic growth. \nIn facilitating rapid infrastructure expansion to lift \na vast proportion of the population out of poverty \nand to accommodate a growing middle-class, they \nclaim 47% of global emissions and 51% of global \nresource extraction from a consumption perspective, \nin absolute terms. They have the highest rate of \nnon-metallic mineral extraction at 68%, are heavy \nmetal ore users and are net-exporters of all four \nresource groups—they are the ‘resource banks’ of the \nglobal economy. The rapid industrialisation of these \ncountries, and the expansion of the middle class, has \noccurred concurrently with improving living standards. \nFigure Five highlights which societal needs require  \nthe heftiest emissions and material footprints, and \nguides us in narrowing our focus for impact.  \nFour key transition arenas arise: prioritising \nsustainable agriculture, especially in products set for \nexport, mainstreaming resource-efficient and low-\ncarbon construction materials, satiating the growing \nappetite for energy with renewable sources where \npossible and establishing infrastructure for effective \nmaterial cycling, including construction and  \ndemolition waste (C&DW). \nCOUNTRY PROFILES: PHYSICAL, SOCIAL \n& ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS\n \nDEMOGRAPHIC  \nINDICATORS\nPopulation 65 7.46 billion people for all countries in each profile\nEmployment in \nagriculture 66 21 percentage of total employment\nECONOMIC  \nINDICATORS\nGross domestic \nProduct 67 60.3 trillion € (Constant 2010) for all countries in each profile\nTrade volume 68 33.7\ntrillion € (Constant 2010) aggregate imports and exports \nfor all countries in each profile\nENERGY INDICATORS\nElectricity access 69 89 percentage of population with access to electricity\nEnergy usage 70 13.1 billion tonnes of oil equivalent used per year\nRenewable energy \nconsumption 71 19.1\npercentage of renewable energy consumption based on \noverall energy consumption*\nMATERIAL INDICATORS\nMaterial footprint 72 92.1\nbillion tonnes of materials used by all countries in each \nprofile\nMaterial footprint per \ncapita 73 12.3 tonnes of materials used per capita per year\nMaterial footprint of \nimports per capita 74 1.8\ntonnes of materials embodied in imports of all countries \nin each profile\nMaterial footprint of \nexports per capita 75 1.8\ntonnes of materials embodied in exports of all countries \nin each profile\nStock build-up 76 28.7\nbillion tonnes of non-metallic minerals used in all \ncountries in each profile*\nWaste generation 77 25.1\nbillion tonnes of waste generated per year for all \ncountries in each profile (excluding mining waste)\nCARBON FOOTPRINT \nINDICATORS\nCarbon footprint 78 50.5\nbillion tonnes of CO 2 equivalents for all countries in the \nprofile (excluding LULUCF)\nCarbon footprint  \nper Capita 79 6.76\ntonnes of CO 2 equivalents per capita for all countries in \nthe profile (excluding LULUCF)\nCarbon footprint of \nimports per capita 80 0.62\ntonnes of CO 2 equivalents per capita embodied in \nimports of all countries in each profile\nCarbon footprint of \nexports per capita 81 0.62 tonnes of CO 2 equivalents per capita embodied in \nexports of all countries in each profile\nBUILD GROW SHIFT\nWORLD\n49\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n48\n",

How we grow, source, process \nand transport our food—and what type of foods we \neat—has a massive impact on both global emissions \nand material use. As agricultural production volumes \nrise and animal farming becomes more prevalent, \nland-use change (LUC) considerations in Build and \nGrow countries come to the fore. This is also due to the \nposition of Grow countries as the largest agricultural \nproducers in the world for virtually all commodities, 82 \nwith almost one-quarter of the population employed \nin agriculture. Animal protein-intensive diets in Shift \ncountries particularly affect agricultural emissions \nascribed to Grow countries, with over 16% of the \ncarbon footprint of the average EU diet attributable to \ndeforestation. 83 As disposable incomes rise across the \nglobe, the pressure to safeguard our earth’s natural \ncarbon sinks —forests—from deforestation in Build and \nGrow countries mounts, as well as moving toward more \nregenerative agricultural practices . Meanwhile, Shift \ncountries should look at reducing the impact of their \noften carbon-intensive diets —from animal products \nto out-of-season products shipped around the globe \nabroad—and high levels of food waste .\nTo create a circular and low-carbon approach \nto agriculture, flows could first and foremost be \nnarrowed  in all country profiles, characterised by an \nefficient use of agricultural land. Across the board, \nthe use of artificial fertilisers, pesticides and other \npollutants should be eliminated to the extent possible \nto maintain healthy, fertile soils and safeguard \nbiodiversity. Implementing a fully-fledged circular \nmodel of regenerative agriculture can drive the desired \noutcomes, whereby animal husbandry is balanced \nwith crop cultivation, allowing waste products to be \ncycled  into inputs: manure becomes fertiliser and crop \ntrimmings and waste become fodder. In Build and Grow \ncountries, resource-efficient practices that combine \nagriculture, forestry and livestock in community-\nmanaged systems are particularly relevant. In addition, \nefforts should be made in all country profiles to \neliminate soil-degrading monocropping. \nRising levels of deforestation in Build and Grow \ncountries—driven by practices such as feed-crop \ncultivation, expansion of pasture land and the planting \nof monocultures, to name a few—should be brought \nto a standstill. This can be done through a mixture of \nlegislative action and rethinking the business model . \nIn fact, research suggests that promoting a market for \nsustainably and responsibly produced goods in Shift \ncountries, may, ultimately, be more effective than policy \naction. 84 This idea is strongly linked to the need for Shift \ncountries to drastically reduce their consumption of \nanimal products, which will have a sizable impact on \nboth deforestation and other environmental indicators. \nShift countries should also focus on narrowing  flows \nby preventing the waste of edible food along the value \nchain. Innovative business models that incorporate \ndigital technology  can help prevent food waste \nat retail and household stages—which amounts to \napproximately 88 million tonnes per year in the EU, or \n173 kilograms per person per year. 85 In Build and Grow \ncountries, preventing losses at farm-stage, rather than \nhousehold stage, is the primary challenge. In Brazil, \nfor example, logistical issues hinder sufficient food \nstorage—resulting in post-harvest losses of a mammoth \n45%.86 Losses can be mitigated with improved storage \ntechnology and infrastructure. On a global scale, food \nloss and waste are responsible for about 8% of GHG \nemissions 87—and all countries have a role to play in \nminimising this figure. \nREGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE: \nBRINGING LIFE BACK TO LAND\nNiger, a country that historically battled \ndesertification, has substantially \nincreased its tree cover by transferring \nthe ownership rights of trees from the \ngovernment—which gave farmers little \nincentive to grow or protect them—to \nthe people. In doing so, farmers can \nmake money from their trees by selling \nbranches, fruit and bark—a more lucrative \nopportunity than felling the trees for \nfirewood. The result has been a surge in \ncommunity-managed forestry systems , \nwith the environmental co-benefits of \nhealthier, more fertile and less dry soil. 88 89 \nIn Brazil, systems-thinking has influenced \nthe Balbo Group to practice regenerative \nagriculture at scale—emulating natural \nprocesses and turning ‘waste’ into a \nresource. 90 The group developed a novel \nsystem for harvesting green cane: a \nmachine splits cane into pieces, feeds the \npieces into a hopper, strips the leaves, \nand returns the matter to the soil. While \nprevious methods involved burning \nsugarcane straw pre-harvest, Balbo’s \nEcosystem Revitalisation Agriculture \n(ERA) feeds 20 tonnes of organic material \nper hectare back into the soil, forming \na mulch that replenishes nutrients, \nlocks in moisture and hinders weed \ngrowth . Along with reduced pesticide \nand fertiliser use, the system provides \n20% higher yields than conventional \nsugarcane production. Across nations, \nCommonland is doing similar work. The \ninitiative’s drylands work in the water-\nscarce region of Altiplano Estepario \nregion, Spain, tackles desertification \nand erosion. 91 Project members planted \n50,000 drought-resistant trees  native \nto the region, implemented measures to \nimprove soil water retention, promoted \nbiodiversity and engaged and mobilised \nlocal farmers and community members.\n51\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n50\n",

      "content": "DESIGN CIRCULARITY \nINTO STOCKS\nWhen it comes to the construction sector, the three \ncountry profiles are worlds apart. Build countries have \nthe unique position where much of their infrastructure \ndevelopment has yet to happen. In stark contrast, in \nthe Grow country of China, for example, more concrete \nwas used in the past three years alone than the US in \nthe entire 20th century. 82 Finally, the fact that Build \nand Grow countries are in the midst of building up \ncrucial stock and infrastructure, while Shift countries \nshould in theory have this available already, further \naggravates the severe difference in consumption \nlevels. We need to make strides in this hard-to-\nabate industry: by designing circularity into new \nconstruction projects  in Build countries and ensuring \nthat it also takes centre stage in infrastructure to \naccommodate Grow’s swiftly growing middle-class—by \nmeans of lightweighting and cycling —we can yield \nsignificant reductions in their emissions and material \nfootprints. Policy in Shift countries should limit \nstock expansion , require the reuse of construction \nmaterials and extend the functional lifetime of \nbuildings and infrastructure  to stem the impact of \none of the globe’s most polluting sectors. \nThe accelerating demand of urbanisation in Build and \nGrow countries necessitates new stock build-up—this \nis evident already. Looking ahead, the opportunity \nexists to narrow  flows by designing for the future , \nand using locally-procured, lightweight materials (like \nwood, clay and loam) to replace emissions-intensive, \ntraditionally linear alternatives such as cement, \nsteel and glass. 93 94 95 96  Advances in architectural and \nengineering applications for regenerative  wooden \nmaterials allow for broader use of locally-sourced and \nrenewable timber, even in high-rise buildings. In Build \ncountries, passive design and durable, climate-resilient \ndesign emerge as priorities. In the case that cement \nuse is absolutely necessary, both Build and Grow \ncountry profiles could slash emissions by replacing \ncarbon-intensive clinker with biological residuals like \nrice husk. An innovative production chain in Brazil, for \nexample, uses açaí pits as a clinker substitute, both \nimproving the sustainability of the energy matrix and \nproviding local jobs in the process. 97 98 \nIn Shift countries, where stock buildup is at a \nrelatively steady level, the focus should be placed on \nmaking the most of what already exists in the built \nenvironment—ultimately slowing  flows to extend the \nfunctional lifetime of buildings through renovation \nrather than demolition. Flows can be narrowed by \nreducing the overall floorspace populations need, and \nby using space more efficiently: in the wake of covid-19, \nwe have seen a decreased need for office space as \nthe professional workforce have been confined to \ntheir homes, raising support for flexible location \nworking and partial home-office arrangements post-\npandemic. This opens up traditional office spaces to be \nretrofitted for a myriad of functions, from housing to \ncommunity space—a practice that should be echoed \nin future design which can incorporate the principles \nof ‘flex buildings’. In the case that new construction \nis necessary, Shift countries should anticipate the \ncycling and regenerating of flows for instance by \nleveraging the urban mine. Modular design and offsite \nconstruction, which can avoid glueing of components, \nboth enable swift disassembly and reassembly of \nmodules, extending the functional lifetime of parts. \nCombined with digital technology such as materials \npassports, 99 which catalogue the products used in \na building and create documented ‘storage units’ of \nmaterials, Shift countries will have an arsenal of tactics \nto make the most of their buildings before, during and \nafter their functional lifetimes.\nMAKE  MOBILITY \nCLEAN\nMobility remains a dominant emitter, especially in \nShift countries where commuting and global travel \nare frequent and car ownership is ubiquitous. But \nBuild countries will see a greater need for passenger \nmobility and freight systems as their cities grow \nrapidly—often with limited urban planning or \ncoordination. In Grow countries, meanwhile, meteoric \nurbanisation has already occurred and mobility \nsystems are under immense strain. The need for \nefficient and sustainable passenger and freight \nmobility  echoes across the profiles. But demand must \nnot be fed with traditional mobility solutions based \non fossil fuel combustion. Instead, urban planning  \nwhich encourages fossil-free mobility and incorporates \nmodern and digital technologies  to regenerate  \nflows should take centre stage. Shifting business \nmodels and behaviour from ownership to sharing  \nand incorporating durable design into vehicles also \nemerge as impactful avenues—especially for Shift \ncountries where the average European car is parked \nfor 92% of the time. 104\nFortunately, circular strategies can pave the way \ntowards sustainable urban mobility. Firstly, all county \nprofiles are able to narrow  carbon and resource \nfootprints by curbing the need for transportation. In \nGrow and Build countries, the rapid expansion of cities \noften coincides with the challenge of creating effective, \nwell-distributed transportation networks. The UN \nestimates that by 2030, 43 ‘mega-cities’ with upwards \nof 10 million inhabitants will span the globe—the \nmajority located in Grow countries. Meanwhile, many \nurbanised Shift cities are now already busy with urban \nplanning initiatives to encourage the de-motorisation \nof transport. Rethinking the business model  and \nincorporating urban planning could create  \nwell-coordinated ‘community villages’, or \nneighbourhoods, where residents can easily \nsatisfy their daily needs—school, work, retail and \nentertainment—by foot, or on bike. This, in turn, \nreduces traffic, congestion and consequential air \npollution. Cities across all profiles may also work \nto reduce emissions by targeting freight mobility. \nInterventions like the creation of ‘pick up points’—\ncollection and distribution depots scattered \nthroughout neighbourhoods—reduce the journeys \ndelivery companies have to make, thereby reducing \ntraffic congestion and emissions. 105 \nBIO-MATERIALS: THE HOLY GRAIL \nOF CIRCULAR CONSTRUCTION\nInnovations in bio-based construction \nmaterials have impacted lives and \nhousing developments in Kenya, where \nresearch team Pamoja Projects has \ndeveloped a material sheet  made of \nresidual waste from corn and rice \ncrops. The technology is both low-cost \nand sustainable, and can be locally \nprocured for use in construction projects \nacross the continent—also boosting \njob creation in rural areas which \nprevents mass migration to urban areas \nunequipped to handle a population \nboom.100 Build countries may continue \nto develop housing and infrastructure \nwith circular strategies in mind—going \nbeyond a sole focus on materials and \nadditionally encompassing social \nwellbeing. Tsoga Environmental Centre, a \ncommunity centre in one of Cape Town’s \ninformal settlements, encapsulates \nthese principles: the project was shaped \nto upskill and employ residents , use \nlocally procured and sustainable \nmaterials  and improve quality of life \nfor the neighborhood’s residents. 101 \nBamboo—which is fast growing and \nprevalent in tropical and subtropical \nregions—is another opportunity for \nbuilding circularity into stocks. The \nPanyaden International School in \nChiang Mai, Thailand, exemplifies the \nbenefits of this beautiful and sustainable \nmaterial: the school commissioned a 782 \nsquare metre sports hall, built from \nbamboo without steel reinforcements \nor connections. The design meets \nmodern safety standards while allowing \nfor natural ventilation, and is entirely \ncarbon-neutral: the CO 2 sequestered by \nthe bamboo during growth was greater \nthan emissions from transportation \nand construction. 102 In Shift countries, \nsimilar advances are being made in the \ndevelopment of novel building materials: \nfor example, the innovative use of \nseaweed  in Danish architecture provides \na material that is naturally rot and fire \nresistant, carbon negative  and repels \npests due to its high salt content. The \nseaweed is used in building panels that \ncan be easily prefabricated—and then \ndisassembled at end-of-life—and acts \nas a natural temperature regulator that \nreduces the need for excessive heating \nand cooling. 103\n53\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n52\n",

      "content": "Urban planners can also implement polycentric \ndesign, where several key districts can coexist and \nfunction as a self-contained ‘city within a city,’ thereby \nshortening commuting distances and increasing public \ntransport use between the sub-centres. 106 Meanwhile, \nparticularly in Shift countries, locked-down nations \nreduced their travel immensely in 2020 as many office-\nbased professionals used digital technologies  to \nmove to online environments—proving that many of us \ndon’t need to commute every day. \nWhile fewer opportunities exist to regenerate  and \nelectrify car transport in Build and Grow countries, \nowing to lower levels of vehicle ownership and less \nexpansive charging infrastructure, they can still \nmake a huge impact by electrifying their scooter \nfleet and public forms of transport. Although some \nShift countries, such as Norway, boast an impressive \nnumber of electric vehicles, additional solutions \nsuch as sustainably generated hydrogen or biofuels \nrepresent interesting avenues for further innovation in \ncombustion engines. It’s not only the fuel for vehicles \nthat makes Mobility in Shift countries very resource \nand emission-intensive, though. Firstly, a large amount \nof materials are funnelled into building transport \ntechnologies such as cars, trains, or ships in the first \nplace. Also, vehicle ownership is very high; electric \nor not. Therefore, Shift countries should investigate \nthe classic slowing  strategy that is especially suited \nto countries that already have a substantial fleet \nof vehicles: rethinking the business model  and \nencouraging car-sharing over ownership.\nTHE NEW MOBILITY: URBAN \nCONNECTIVITY, ELECTRIFICATION \nAND SHARING SYSTEMS\nActions to stimulate a modal shift are \nalready occurring across Build countries, \nfrom the introduction of high-speed \nelectric trains  connecting cities in India, 107 \nto the revitalisation of colonial-era rail \nsystems across Africa. 108 Currently, Africa’s \ntransportation capacity is fairly limited \nto road transport, with up to 90% of \npeople moving from A to B with motorised \nvehicles, resulting in severe congestion in \nurban centres. Revamping rail systems  \nwill finally reconnect secondary cities \nto nationwide networks—presenting a \ncrucial opportunity for both emissions \nreduction and improved urban planning. \nThe importance of urban planning \nin inspiring modal shifts is clear: in \nMyanmar, for example, the past decades \nof urbanisation saw the development \nof wide-laned rural roads in urban \ncentres , with no transitional public \nspace and often susceptible to flooding. \nChanges in planning policy began to \naccommodate cyclists and pedestrians  \nthrough narrowing lanes, eventually \nresulting in measurable reductions in \nemissions and air pollution. 109 Meanwhile, \ncircular mobility in Grow countries can \ntake the form of electrification and sharing \nsystems. As scooters are the predominant \nform of transport in many countries \nacross this profile, sharing systems for \nelectric scooters  are on the rise across \nBrazil, China, Malaysia, Mexico and South \nAfrica,110 allowing for more individualised \nmobility. In Shift countries, car sharing \nis enjoying a spike in success—especially \nas companies like Zipcar spread across \nthe globe, establishing roots in over 500 \ncities. With the tagline ‘Own the trip, not \nthe car’ the company works to change \nestablished attitudes about ownership  \nby providing the convenience of car use \nwithout the hassleshassles of maintenance \nand repair.111\nPhoto by Vishal Shah\n55\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n54\n",

      "content": "IMPROVE  WASTE \nMANAGEMENT\nIncreasing affluence in Build and Grow countries—\nespecially the swelling middle class in the latter—will \nsee a concurrent increase in waste, not yet matched \nby sufficient waste management infrastructure. \nWaste management is a crucial enabler of the circular \neconomy, as recovering materials or energy from \nwaste is necessary to close loops and provides a \ncontinuous stream of resources. In the absence \nof waste management systems, or when they are \noverloaded with other countries’ waste, unregulated \nopen-fire burning—which emits black carbon and \nharmful toxins—has become an issue of mounting \nurgency for both environmental and human health.  \nIt is estimated that over 40% of the globe’s solid waste \nis burned in open fires, with a significantly higher \nproportion in lower-income countries. 112 Without \nsufficient infrastructure to collect, sort and process \nwaste, this rate is only set to increase. Linked to this \nissue is the rate of waste Shift countries export out \nto other countries, where there can be insufficient \nvalorisation of waste materials . While waste \ninfrastructure in Shift countries often runs smoothly, \nmuch work is yet to be done to fully close material \nloops and make the most of what we consider waste .\nWaste management priorities vary widely between \ncountry profiles. In many cases, kerbside waste \ncollection in Build countries is limited, and rarely \nreaches large unregistered settlements on the \nperiphery of dense urban zones. In these areas, \nwaste collection is largely organised and conducted \nthrough informal workers, also prevalent in some Grow \ncountries, who can face significant social and health \nchallenges in the absence of formalised unions. This \ndemonstrates a need to rethink the business model , \nbeginning with the empowerment, formalisation \nand eventual upskilling of waste pickers—before \nattempting to build up recycling or incineration plants. \nBuild and Grow countries can endeavour to future \nwaste flows by limiting the amount of waste produced \nin the first place—for example, through bans on \nsingle-use items, or measures to address the sachet \neconomy prevalent in lower-income communities. \nOnce sufficient infrastructure has been built for \nprocessing and segregating waste, flows can be cycled  \nby finding alternative end-points for waste—such as \nthe transformation of organic waste into biogas.  \nIdeal avenues for cycling  in Grow countries may \ninclude industrial symbiosis approaches, where closely \nlocated industrial activities utilise each other’s waste \nstreams. \nShift countries produce the highest levels of \nwaste—11.6 billion tonnes per annum for all countries \nin the profile. As levels of collection and processing \nare relatively high, the priority here becomes reducing \noverall waste volumes. Countries can design for \nthe future , eliminating excess resource use in \npackaging and product design, and prioritise the \nuse of regenerative resources , for example by using \nbiodegradable materials for packaging or certain \nproduct components. In managing the waste volumes \nthat still arise, Shift countries must stop exporting \ntheir recyclable waste to Build and Grow countries, \nwhere processing facilities lack capacity. Policymakers \nand governments can also team up to create value  \nand further roll-out schemes like Extended Producer \nResponsibility to hold corporations accountable for \ntheir waste. As technology is developed to process \ncurrently non-recyclable waste, landfills should be \neliminated, with a view to remediating affected areas \nand restoring degraded ecosystems.\nRAMPING UP RECYCLING: WASTE \nPICKERS, REUSE SOLUTIONS AND \nDIGITAL TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology-based solutions come into play \nin unifying the informal sector, as seen \nin the case of Kabadiwalla Connect. The \nIndian company provides cost-effective \nand low-carbon solutions for waste \ncollection, segregation and processing  \nthrough spatial mapping, digitalisation, \nsourcing and reverse logistics solutions \nthat integrate informal workers into \nthe system. For non-recyclable waste, \nother solutions emerge: community \nmembers can create ‘eco-bricks’ to use in \nconstruction, using waste as a resource  \nby stuffing plastic bottles with non-\nrecyclable waste, which are then used to \nform interlocking blocks. Port Elizabeth, \nSouth Africa, will boast the world’s largest \neco brick building: a school built entirely \nof the material, spearheaded by non-\nprofit EcoBrick Exchange. 113 It should be \nnoted that higher-value applications or \nrecycling are preferable on the waste \nmanagement hierarchy—but nonetheless, \nthe project has already removed over 10 \ntonnes of waste from the community. \nProjects that increase accurate sorting, \na crucial component of high-quality \nrecycling, are also on the rise—as \nexemplified by UK-based pioneer project \nHolyGrail. The startup’s approach is to \ntag recyclables with codes unique to their \ncomposition, using chemical tracers and \ndigital watermarks. Preliminary results \nare promising, demonstrating that digital \nwatermark technology  can be applied in \na myriad of situations and retrofitted into \nexisting waste facilities—thus allowing for \nimproved sorting rates, and consequently, \nhigher levels of plastic recycling. \n57\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n56\n",

This allows us to shape climate pledges \nfor the globe guided by the lessons we have learnt \nover the last year. We live in a world that is only \n8.6% circular and nowhere near limiting warming \nto below 2-degrees. This report can guide countries \nin making the course-correction we so desperately \nneed: for the economy, ecology and society. This \nchapter details the barriers and enabling factors \nfor a circular roadmap in the Build, Grow and Shift \nprofiles, as well as assessing the efficacy of their \ncurrent climate pledges: the NDCs. Across the \nboard, current NDCs are overwhelmingly focused \non the energy transition. Circular nations are  \nnot only more resource-efficient and low carbon, \nbut there are many co-benefits to be enjoyed.  \nFor countries, this truly is their time. \nENABLING THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION IN \nBUILD COUNTRIES\nBuild countries have a number of contextual \nfactors to consider in creating an enabling \nenvironment for the successful uptake of circular \nstrategies. They are resource-rich and place a high \nfocus on the extraction and sale of raw materials, \nbut fall short in HDI indicators like education \nand healthcare. The good news: they have yet to \nbuild up much of their infrastructure, presenting \na key opportunity to embed circularity in their \npractices and NDC pledges surrounding biomass, \nconstruction, mobility and waste management.  \nWhen it comes to legislation and policy, in Build \ncountries, teaming up to create joint value is crucial in \nbetter-enforcing laws and in requiring multinationals—\noften from Shift countries—to take charge of their \nvalue-chain impacts across the world. While tackling \ndeforestation is imperative, and often well-addressed \nin Build NDCs, the reality is politically fraught 114 115 \n116 117 —and well-articulated laws are often broken, 118 \nresulting in half of all tropical deforestation  \nhappening illegally. 104 \nSimilarly, lax regulations have allowed for the growth \nof unplanned urban ‘sprawl’ around the periphery of \nBuild cities—whilst this housing is urgently needed, \nit must be sufficiently planned for—, 120 hindering the \nimplementation of distributed mobility systems and \nefficient waste collection. The implementation of \nenvironmental regulation and planning can be stifled \nwith structural enforcement issues and corruption; \ntherefore, addressing these obstacles through \nincreased transparency and control is imperative \nto facilitating sustainable growth and protection of \nnatural capital in Build countries.\nBuild countries are also often characterised by a high \nprevalence of informal workers: in Africa, as much \nas 86% of the population is employed in the informal \nsector.121 Teaming up to create joint value and aligning \nthe role of the decentralised labour sector with waste \nmanagement processes will be necessary to reduce \nfootprints and material use from both construction \nand demolition waste (C&DW) and solid municipal \nwaste. Burning—which can occur at major landfills, \nsmall dumpsites or households—may be spurred \nby a desire to uncover non-flammable materials \nlike metals for scavenging. By introducing waste \nmanagement infrastructure, halting waste-imports \nfrom Shift countries and formalising waste pickers—\nallowing them to work in safer conditions in processing \nfacilities—these issues may be addressed. \nFinally, actions taken across Build countries must be \nholistic in nature, and consider the complexities of the \nissues at hand. Previous efforts to address the waste \nproblem, for example, have seen donors pouring \nfinancial resources into one big project, as results are \neasier to monitor. 122 Such projects may lack qualities \nnecessary for and specific to localities, and because \nthey do not take the wider context into consideration, \noften go out of business or lack economic viability. 123 \nWell-intentioned but misguided policies can backfire \nwithout a long-term approach and consideration of \nknock-on effects. The need for holistic action plans  \nand participatory approaches—that consider the \npeople these measures will affect—applies across \nsectors and geographies. \nPRIORITIES FOR BUILD COUNTRIES’ NDCS\nDespite the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change’s recognition of ‘common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities’, which acknowledges the \ncomparatively minimal contribution of Build countries \nto climate breakdown, these countries’ NDCs showcase \nstrong ambitions and detailed action plans for climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation. Their contributions, \nat times, detail the importance of shifting attitudes and \nhabits as well as honing in on technology and finance. \nPhoto by Luiz Clas \n59\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021",

      "content": "India, for example, pledges to ‘propagate a healthy \nand sustainable way of living based on traditions and \nvalues of conservation and moderation’, and notes \nthat we ‘must promote...sustainable lifestyles across \nthe globe’.124 Although it varies by country, circular \nstrategies pop up within Build NDCs, especially in the \nrealms of agriculture, forestry, energy efficiency and \nrenewables expansion. In Ethiopia’s NDC, for instance, \nagriculture and forestry are prioritised as they have \nthe greatest emissions mitigation potential, while \nKenya focuses on continuing to grow their already \nmostly clean energy mix by enhancing solar, wind and \ngeothermal development. While these countries are \ngenerally on track regarding circularity and mitigation \nefforts, often with a strong additional focus on building \nresilience, there is room for growth. \nMoving forward, Build countries can place a greater \nemphasis on developing circular construction and \nmobility systems, facilitated by cutting-edge urban \nplanning and powered by renewables. Further \nchallenges may arise in the implementation of the \ntransition pathways already well-aligned with country \nNDCs; as corruption and political instability prevail, \neffective policy-making is vulnerable to manipulation \nfrom special interest groups. 125 For Build countries \nto successfully close both Gaps, well-intentioned \nlegislation must be backed by strong political will and \nenforcement, and global markets must adapt to create \nroom for sustainably produced goods and services \nfrom these regions. \nENABLING THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION IN \nGROW COUNTRIES\nGrow countries have experienced rising levels \nof industrialisation, as well as higher living \nstandards in recent years. This profile’s resource \nuse is characterised by fast economic growth—\nand material consumption increasing in tandem. \nSustainable growth must, therefore, focus on using \nnatural capital more efficiently, as well as further \ndeveloping human capital. Key strategies for Grow \ncountries in ramping up their NDCs will include \nincorporating circular design in construction, with \na focus on public procurement, and safeguarding \ntheir biomass.\nFor our recommendations to be successfully \nincorporated in Grow countries, a number of enabling \nfactors may be considered. Cultural elements once \nagain come into play, as with Build countries: circular \nstrategies must engage with those that they affect \non a deep level, or the long-term uptake and success \nof those strategies will dwindle. Social co-benefits \nof the proposed interventions must be highlighted: \nfor example, farmers are generally eager to use food \nwaste as feed because it reduces their costs by up to \n60%.126 Initiatives focused on curtailing deforestation \nmust similarly provide economic incentives to those \non-the-ground to see success; research indicates \nthat providing income-generating opportunities, \nwhich will impact the lives of those that take part \nin illegal logging, are considerably more effective \nthan enforcement of law alone. 127 128 Additionally, the \nformalisation of informal workers must place people at \nthe fore, prioritising safety, health and respect. \nOnce again, stringent legislation related to multiple \nsectors—forestry and urban planning among them—\nis relevant to Grow countries’ circular transition. \nRegulations must reflect circular goals: not allowing, for \nexample, the construction of wide-laned rural roads \nin urban centres that fail to prioritise pedestrians, or \nurban sprawl that impedes walkability. Urban planning \nalso encompasses the built environment, much of \nwhich is developed and operated under government \nauthority in Grow countries—thus enabling public \nprocurement to be a key driver of the circular \nconstruction transition, boosting demand for efficient \nand secondary material use. Incorporating digital \ntechnology and making the most of new recycling \napproaches for C&DW will be crucial, and should be \ndone in tandem with the formalisation and eventual \nupskilling of the informal sector.\nPRIORITIES FOR GROW COUNTRIES’ NDCS\nThe NDCs of Grow countries are generally strong, \ncharacterised by a solid level of detail in their \nemissions mitigation plans. As the largest economy—\nand the biggest emitter—in the profile, China \nsteps to the fore as the circular economy leader, \nexhibiting a range of interventions from building up \nrecycling infrastructure and eco-industrial parks, to \nimplementing low-carbon agriculture techniques and \nreusing organic waste. \nWhile other Grow countries vary in their levels of \ndetail and target mitigation areas, most NDCs would \nbenefit from an increased focus on circularity in the \nconstruction sector—especially as urbanisation in \nthese regions will continue to spur the expansion \nof the built environment. The importance of a \nfunctioning, future-focused waste management \nsector—that both collects and segregates waste at \nscale and produces high-quality secondary materials—\nis also generally overlooked. While the urgent need \nto halt deforestation and turn to more regenerative \npractices in agriculture is generally afforded attention \nin Grow NDCs, countries moving forward must align \nlegislation with strong political action that enforces \nlaws and punishes illegal logging and burning. In the \nfuture, Grow countries can create tangible routes \nfor action by placing an even stronger emphasis on \ncircular strategies, coupled with holistic plans for \nimplementation that benefit the planet and people. \nENABLING THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION IN \nSHIFT COUNTRIES\nShift countries consume a vast volume of \nmaterials and, simultaneously, produce large \namounts of waste, falling far outside of healthy \nplanetary boundaries. A number of the social and \nenvironmental externalities that result from Shift \ncountries’ actions occur elsewhere—ultimately \nindicating that nations in this profile must further \ntake responsibility for their consumption and \nemissions. The richest 1% of the global population \naccount for more emissions than the poorest \n50%.129 As Shift countries further develop their \nnational climate pledges, they will benefit from \nstrong circular policies embedded across sectors. \nThis will also reflect the rising activism in these \nnations which is an increasingly influential factor in \nsocial change.\nIn Shift countries, which have implemented much of \ntheir housing, infrastructure and mobility systems \nand are growing at a slower pace than Build and Grow, \none priority emerges: governments must drive the \ntransition as much as possible with legislation and \npolicy. This is crucial in achieving what markets cannot: \nabolishing fossil fuel subsidies, regulating fertiliser \nand pesticide use, and enforcing stringent building \nefficiency requirements, amongst other measures. \nA second priority is shifting the attitudes and \nperceptions of populations. It will be crucial to tackle \nconsumer beliefs that typically place object ownership \non a pedestal over object sharing, 130 131 as well as beliefs \nthat enmesh success with materialism. Additional \ngovernment focus may be placed on awareness and \neducational campaigns that work to shift cultural \nbarriers, for example regarding perceptions of what \nconstitutes a healthy diet. Currently in Shift countries, \nmuch of the onus for sustainability falls on the private \nsector; it will also likely rest with producers to create \na greater market for ethically produced goods, and \nfor architectural and engineering firms, infrastructure \ndevelopers and construction companies to implement \nprinciples of circular design. \nAs with the other country profiles, all legislation or \npolicy implemented must be holistic and address and \nsupport various actors teaming up to create joint value \nthroughout the value-chain. To illustrate: consider \nthe advent of laws that prevent supermarkets from \ndestroying edible food. While well-intentioned, these \ndid not address knock-on effects. For example, food \nbanks without sufficient infrastructure for perishable \ngoods were overwhelmed by massive influxes of \ndonations, highlighting the necessity for collaboration \namong actors. 132 Furthermore, circular and sustainable \npublic procurement is one of the most effective tools \nat governments’ disposal to catalyse the transition, \nand is increasingly being recognised as a means of \nfinancing sustainable construction, for example. \nWhile collaboration is demonstrably crucial, it must \ngo hand-in-hand with strong legislation that creates \nthe conditions for circular or sustainable companies to \nflourish—while targeting those that do the opposite. To \nthis end, Shift country governments must lead the way \nin taking responsibility and corporate accountability \nfor the impact their lifestyles can have on other \ncountries, especially due to their huge reach over \nsupply chains. This must be done with strong political \nwill that doesn’t fall prey to the interests of lobbyists. \nIn 2010, for example, the newly proposed American \nClean Energy and Security Act was the ‘most promising’ \npiece of climate legislation in the US to date 133 134 —yet \nprivate-sector companies expecting losses spent more \nthan 575 million euros lobbying the bill, eventually \ndriving its failure. Novel research shows that political \nopposition against cap-and-trade climate policy can \nbe reduced by freely allocating subsets of permits \nto regulated firms, within the cap—reducing costs \nfor regulated firms yet not impacting environmental \ngoals.135 This is particularly relevant to Shift countries, \nwhich often tout market-based climate solutions.\nPRIORITIES FOR SHIFT COUNTRIES’ NDCS\nMost Shift countries are the highest global emitters \nand it is the opinion of many that the burden of climate \nmitigation should fall on their shoulders. 136 Despite \nthis, Shift action plans are largely vague, and many \ncountries in this profile are not on track to meet these \nloose goals. In the years directly succeeding the Paris \nAgreement, Shift countries’ emissions have continued \nto climb, illuminating the breadth of work to be done \n61\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n60\n",

      "content": "on overhauling the NDCs and working to implement \nstrong policy. Rising frustration at the failure of Shift \ncountries to commit to strong action has triggered \npowerful movements of climate activism in recent \nyears, especially among young people—yet more work \nremains to be done as Shift countries review their \nNDCs and climate policies in the coming years. \nCurrently, most Shift NDCs have built-in high levels of \nflexibility, and often mention target areas for reduction \nwithout detailing specific mitigation measures. In this \nway, vague goals set by governments fail to translate \nthe necessary clarity and ambition to key actors to \ndrive the change together. This has resulted in market-\nbased approaches like carbon pricing that are just too \nnarrow and weak to meet our climate goals. As long as \ncarbon remains underpriced and ambitious reduction \ntargets are only given for the distant future, Shift NDCs \ncannot reflect the mitigation ambition required—\nmassive, systemic change. Circular strategies are few \nand far between in this profile’s action plans, with the \nexception of Japan and Chile—which do list detailed \nstrategies under a broad range of mitigation areas and \nincorporate principles of circularity throughout. \nOn the whole, the transformation of energy supply, \ncircular housing, mobility and sustainable food \nsystems need more attention and speed—with these \ntransformations requiring significant investment into \ninfrastructure, policy and behavioural change, beyond \nthe functional capacities of the private sector. Now, \nin 2021, the political climate leading up to the COP26  \nforeshadows promising change: the EU parliament has \nvoted in favour of increasing the targets of Member \nStates, aiming for a 60% reduction in emissions by \n2030, while the Biden Presidency will see the US rejoin \nthe Paris Agreement. Shift countries have an excellent \nopportunity to formulate more defined blueprints, \nsupported by circular strategies, towards closing the \nEmissions Gap.\nPhoto by Sunyu Kim\n63\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n62\n",

      "content": "Tackling climate change calls for course-correction and \na systemic-thinking approach. In looking beyond single \nvariables, such as renewables or energy efficiency, we \nneed a rounded understanding of our impact on the \nworld. To achieve such a big shift, climate mitigation \nstrategies must harness the transformative power \nof the circular economy. As our report illustrates, \nthese twin agendas of change working in tandem can \ncarry us down the road to a world that is well below \n2-degrees warmer by 2032. And this massive impact \nwill—on paper—only mean upping the circularity of \nthe world by a further 8.4%.\nDoubling circularity from its current figure of 8.6% will \nrequire us to pivot away from business-as-usual—for \ngood. Yet, the take-make-waste habits of the linear \neconomy are proving very hard to shake, and time \nis not on our side. Even if every one of the current \nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) were \nfulfilled, temperatures could still rise to 3.2-degrees \nwithin this century. \nYet our report illustrates that transition pathways \nthat are systemic and transformative are available. \nWhether from the perspective of a Build, Grow or \nShift profile, countries can fulfil their societal needs \nin resource-efficient and low-carbon ways—by doing \nmore with less. By applying circular strategies at the \nintersection of materials and emissions hotspots, \ncountries can increase cycling and value-retention \nand cut excessive consumption, thereby slashing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This is how narrowing the \nCircularity Gap closes the Emissions Gap.\nBut, where do we begin? This big shift towards a more \ncircular tomorrow starts by adopting strategic steps \nto bridge the gaps through leadership and action. \nThese steps can embed circular economy principles \nand practices into the NDCs of individual countries, as \nwell as facilitate policy and market frameworks that \nexplicitly incentivise circular outcomes at all levels. \nThese linkages serve to strengthen and align local \nactions with global aims.\nThe steps also bring people together and make \nconnections across national, cultural, societal, sectoral \nand professional boundaries—to enable collaborative \nendeavours and engender collective responsibility. \n8. THE WAY FORWARD\nFrom knowledge sharing to brand allyship, this \ncoalition of the willing is a powerful agent for \naccelerating change. In the short term, our roadmap \nto a well below 2-degree world should leverage the \npolicy-making platform provided by the upcoming \nCOP26. It must, though, look beyond Glasgow, and \ntowards longer-term climate legislation, too. Our \nvision for closing the Circularity Gap needs to be both \nambitious and actionable.\nIf the events of 2020 taught us anything, it is that \nwe can think the unthinkable and even do the \nundoable. Climate mitigation and a circular economy \nare undoubtedly difficult; but, together, they are not \nundoable.\nBRIDGE THE GAPS THROUGH \nLEADERSHIP AND ACTION\n \n1. Build a coalition for action that is both diverse and \ninclusive. Bringing a diverse community of businesses, \ngovernments, NGOs and academics together to boost \ncapacity and capability will accelerate collective action \ntoward circularity, serving the betterment of societal needs \nand global ecological health. This will enable action toward \nreaching the Paris Agreement’s goals before it’s too late and \nbegin to build the necessary infrastructure and alliances to \ncollect, retrieve and share circular knowledge on a global \nlevel.\n2. Integrate plans for leveraging the circular economy \ninto national climate pledges.  Circular strategies suited \nto different country profiles can get nations back on a well \nbelow 2-degree pathway. Integrating tailored plans can also \nenable better goal-setting, measurement and benchmarking \nfor countries in the NDC revision process, and ensure that \neach nation can address global issues in a way that aligns to \ntheir local context, incentives and mandates. This can also \nsupport key industries that need to shoulder the change.\n3. Create an enabling environment to facilitate the \ncircular transition. Market and regulatory failures that \ninhibit the enabling conditions needed for circular initiatives \nto reach scale can be addressed by policymakers; including \nsteering away from financial models that only support linear \nprojects. Capital must also be mobilised toward circular \ninitiatives to unlock the potential of ‘building back better’.\nPhoto by Denys Nevozhai\n65\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2021\n64\n",

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted business-as-usual, highlighting the fragility of our linear economic system.  Calls for a green recovery are strong, emphasizing the need to address climate breakdown while recovering from the pandemic. The 2021 Circularity Gap Report quantifies the circular economy's potential for climate change mitigation, particularly relevant for the upcoming UN climate summit.  Smarter global resource use can close the widening Circularity and Emissions Gaps, putting us back on track to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius as per the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2020, the world consumed over 100 billion tonnes of materials, with only 8.6% recycled. This \"take-make-waste\" linear economy, while enabling growth, has led to overconsumption and negatively impacted planetary health and social equity.  In 2017, human activities surpassed the threshold of 1-degree global warming, reaching 1.1 degrees in 2020.  Even with current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), global temperatures are projected to rise by 3.2 degrees this century.  This Emissions Gap underscores the need for more extreme action. The delayed COP26 summit in 2020 makes 2021 a pivotal year for climate action.\n</chunk>",

MIND THE GAPS: Emissions and material hotspots in the linear economy\n\nThe global economy's circularity rate declined from 9.1% in 2018 to 8.6% in 2020, widening the Circularity Gap.  Simultaneously, the world surpassed 100 billion tonnes of annual material consumption and 1-degree warming. This report presents an x-ray of global GHG emissions, illustrating how they flow through the economy.  By considering both mass and carbon, we can reduce material consumption, increase value retention, and slash emissions.\n\nThe report's x-ray of global GHG emissions shows that 70% of emissions originate from material handling and use at the point of final consumption.  Fossil fuels account for 65% of embodied emissions, followed by biomass production (26%) largely related to land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF).  Ores and minerals contribute 8% of embodied emissions.  The emissions shift from energy carriers (70% in the processing stage) to materials (70% at the consumption stage).\n\nProviding mobility, housing, and nutrition accounts for nearly 70% of global emissions.  Mobility leads with 17.1 billion tonnes, mainly from fossil fuel combustion. Housing contributes 13.5 billion tonnes due to extraction, transport, construction, and energy use. Nutrition accounts for 10 billion tonnes, with LULUCF playing a significant role.  The remaining 30% of emissions are attributed to communications, services, consumables, and healthcare. The analysis uses a Mass-Carbon lens, combining material and emissions footprints to identify impactful intervention areas.  While minerals represent the largest share of materials (51%), their emissions contribution is small (2.8%). Fossil fuels contribute modestly to materials (15%) but significantly to emissions (65%).  Biomass contributes 25% of materials and 27% of emissions. Circular strategies can reconfigure supply chains to bypass emissions hotspots.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "Global circularity is declining, alongside rising material consumption and emissions.  The report reveals that 70% of global GHG emissions stem from material handling and use at the consumption stage, with fossil fuels (65%) and biomass (26%) being the largest contributors.  Mobility, housing, and nutrition account for 70% of total emissions.  A \"Mass-Carbon\" analysis highlights the disproportionate emissions impact of fossil fuels compared to their material contribution, suggesting circular economy strategies targeting these hotspots can significantly reduce emissions.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\n# 3. METRICS BEHIND THE GAPS: Global circularity and the Emissions Gap\n\nConsistent measurement frameworks are crucial for informed decision-making regarding circularity and climate mitigation. The Circularity Metric tracks global circularity, highlighting the Circularity Gap.  The Emissions Gap, as defined by UNEP, assesses the difference between current GHG emissions and the level needed to stay on a below-2-degree warming trajectory.  This report uses both gaps to demonstrate the mutually reinforcing relationship between circularity and climate mitigation.\n\nThe Circularity Metric focuses on the global material metabolism, considering six fundamental dynamics: minimizing lithosphere extraction, promoting regenerative biomass, minimizing material dispersion and loss, and employing strategies to narrow, slow, regenerate, and cycle material flows.  The Emissions Gap, referenced in this report, is defined in relation to a 1.75-degree trajectory by 2032.  The 2020 Emissions Gap Report projected a 3.2-degree temperature rise by 2100 under current NDCs, highlighting their inadequacy.  Circular economy strategies are estimated to close over 70% of the Emissions Gap.  The methodology draws on Environmentally-extended Multi-regional Input-Output Analysis (EE-MRIOA), using the Exiobase database and considering consumption patterns, production recipes, and adoption rates of circular interventions.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "This report uses the Circularity Metric and the Emissions Gap Report to show the link between circular economy and climate change mitigation.  The Circularity Metric tracks global material flows, aiming to minimize extraction and maximize reuse. The Emissions Gap reveals the shortfall in emission reductions needed to meet climate goals.  The report finds that circular economy strategies could significantly close (over 70%) this Emissions Gap,  using data from EE-MRIOA analysis.\n",

BRIDGING THE GAPS: Our roadmap to a well below 2-degree world\n\nThis chapter explores the transformative power of circular economy strategies to achieve intelligent material use, tackle overconsumption, and reduce GHG emissions.  The roadmap presented utilizes \"what-if\" scenarios based on strategies that narrow, slow, regenerate, or cycle material flows across societal needs.  These scenarios aim to manage climate change and resource use within planetary boundaries.\n\nThe roadmap considers nine planetary boundaries, focusing on climate mitigation through resource management. It examines seven societal needs and wants (Housing, Nutrition, Mobility, Communications, Services, Consumables, and Healthcare), incorporating ethical considerations and trade-offs.  The scenarios highlight interventions' potential impact and are not grounded in current political realities. They are not quantitatively modeled year-by-year.\n\nThe roadmap uses NDCs as a starting point, excluding interventions frequently mentioned in initial NDCs (renewable energy, energy-efficient appliances, public transport). This highlights the additional impact of circular economy strategies beyond current pledges.  The four circular flow strategies (narrow, slow, regenerate, cycle) address both GHG emissions and material footprints.  Narrowing flows minimizes material inputs and emissions, regenerating flows replaces fossil fuels and pollutants with regenerative sources, slowing flows extends product lifespans, and cycling flows optimizes material reuse.\n</chunk>",

This section quantifies the roadmap's effectiveness in Mass-Carbon terms, highlighting the urgency of the situation and the need to move beyond business-as-usual.\n\nMaterial extraction has fueled economic growth since the Industrial Revolution, leading to increased GHG emissions.  The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily reduced emissions due to lockdowns, demonstrating the potential for rapid behavioral change.  However, a sustained reduction requires substantial policy shifts.  A green recovery could reduce emissions by 25% compared to pre-pandemic policies. Climate breakdown is projected to be the biggest global health threat of the century.\n\nResource efficiency reduces GHG emissions across the value chain. The roadmap's interventions, detailed in Figure Four, can cut total global emissions by 39%. Two-thirds of this reduction is attributed to supply-chain emission reductions, while one-third is due to reduced direct emissions.  The interventions' impact varies across societal needs, with Housing, Mobility, and Nutrition showcasing the largest potential. The roadmap also aims to reduce resource extraction by 28%. Limitations exist due to non-synergistic relationships between interventions. The combined interventions could nearly double the global circularity metric (from 8.6% to 17%), achieving a below 2-degree warming scenario by 2032 if coupled with NDC implementation, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "To achieve a circular economy and limit global warming to well below 2 degrees, drastic changes are needed.  A proposed roadmap, focusing on resource efficiency and supply chain emission reductions, could cut global emissions by 39% and nearly double the global circularity rate (to 17%), potentially reaching net-zero by 2050 if combined with existing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).  This requires significant policy shifts and prioritizes interventions in housing, mobility, and nutrition sectors.  However, limitations exist due to intervention interdependencies.\n",

This chapter builds on the country profiles (Build, Grow, Shift) from the 2020 report, recognizing that no country perfectly fits one profile.  It focuses on high-impact areas (Nutrition, Housing, Mobility, waste management) for each profile.\n\nDespite differences, common needs and structural parallels exist.  No country currently resides within a safe and just space.  Carbon inequality is a major concern; the richest 10% account for nearly half of cumulative CO2 emissions, while the poorest 50% account for only 7%.  Lower-income nations are most vulnerable to climate change impacts. The report considers the emissions and material footprints of each profile, tailoring diagnoses and suggesting interventions for Nutrition, Housing, Mobility, and waste management.\n\n**Build countries:** Characterized by low material consumption per capita, they are responsible for a smaller share of global emissions but struggle to meet basic needs.  High-impact interventions focus on reforming agriculture, circular construction, accessible mobility solutions, and integrated waste management.\n\n**Grow countries:**  Rapidly industrializing and experiencing economic growth, they consume significantly more resources and produce a larger share of emissions.  Key strategies involve circular design in construction, safeguarding biomass, and efficient resource use.\n\n**Shift countries:**  High material consumption and emissions, they require significant reductions in consumption and waste through policy and behavioral change. Priorities include stringent legislation, shifting public attitudes towards consumption and sharing, and corporate accountability.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "This chapter proposes tailored climate action plans based on three country profiles (Build, Grow, Shift) from a previous report.  While acknowledging national differences, it emphasizes common needs and the urgent need to address carbon inequality.  The chapter focuses on high-impact areas (nutrition, housing, mobility, waste) and suggests specific interventions for each profile: sustainable agriculture and waste management for \"Build\" countries; circular economy strategies for \"Grow\" countries; and consumption reduction policies for \"Shift\" countries.\n",

This chapter analyzes barriers and enabling factors for a circular transition in each country profile and assesses the efficacy of current NDCs.\n\n**Build countries:**  Challenges include enforcing laws, managing informal workers in waste management, and addressing corruption.  NDCs often prioritize agriculture, forestry, and renewable energy.  Future focus should be on circular construction and mobility, supported by urban planning and renewables.\n\n**Grow countries:**  Enabling factors involve engaging local communities, providing economic incentives (e.g., for sustainable farming), and formalizing informal sectors.  NDCs often include plans for renewable energy, but circular strategies in construction and waste management need more emphasis.  Strong legislation and enforcement are crucial.\n\n**Shift countries:**  Governments need to drive the transition through legislation (e.g., eliminating fossil fuel subsidies), addressing consumer attitudes, and promoting circular public procurement.  NDCs often lack specificity and detail; stronger targets and circular strategies are required.  Collaboration is important but needs to be combined with strong legislation to hold corporations accountable for their global impacts.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "This chapter assesses the effectiveness of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in enabling a global circular economy, noting COP26 delays and COVID-19 impacts.  It finds that \"build,\" \"grow,\" and \"shift\" countries face distinct challenges:  \"Build\" countries need to improve waste management and focus on circular construction/mobility; \"Grow\" countries require community engagement, economic incentives, and stronger waste/construction strategies; and \"Shift\" countries must strengthen legislation (e.g., ending fossil fuel subsidies), address consumer behavior, and improve NDC detail with stronger, accountable circular economy targets.\n",

Doubling global circularity (from 8.6% to 17%) is crucial to stay below a 2-degree warming scenario by 2032.  Even with current NDCs, temperatures could still rise significantly.  The roadmap provides transformative pathways for all country profiles, enabling resource-efficient and low-carbon development.\n\nBridging the gaps requires three key steps:\n\n1.  **Build a diverse and inclusive coalition:**  This will accelerate action toward circularity, enhance knowledge sharing, and build the necessary infrastructure and alliances.\n\n2.  **Integrate circular economy plans into NDCs:**  Tailored circular strategies can put nations back on a below-2-degree pathway, improving goal-setting and benchmarking.\n\n3.  **Create an enabling environment:**  Policymakers must address market and regulatory failures, steering capital towards circular initiatives.\n\n\nThe upcoming COP26 provides a crucial platform to leverage these steps, but long-term climate legislation is also needed. The circular economy is challenging but not impossible to achieve.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "To limit global warming to 2 degrees, a systemic approach integrating climate mitigation and a circular economy is crucial.  Doubling global circularity by 2032 is vital, even with current commitments.  This requires: 1) building a diverse coalition, 2) integrating circular economy plans into national climate commitments (NDCs), and 3) creating a supportive policy environment. COP26 offers a key opportunity to advance this, alongside the need for long-term legislation.\n",
