The book was \npublished by Palgrave Macmillan in 2020 and addresses the students’ and companies’ \nneed for learning valuable lessons; it was intended to be a practical guide for the \nnecessary business models and system shifting within known industries. This book is \nthe subject matter of the research regarding this scientific article (Lacy et al., 2020). The \nauthors of the presented book also wrote other books published within the framework \nof the topics of the circular economy, waste management, growth and sustainability \nissues, written on the basis of their academic and expert analyses and rich experience \nwithin the specialized of waste management, sustainability and ecology.\nWithin the part of book review entitled The Methodology and Goal of the Paper , the \nscientific goals of this review and the methodology used will be acknowledged. \nWithin the part of the book review entitled The Paper Results with Discussion , the \npresented book content will be analyzed within the existing structure of the book. The \nbook is structured into three separate and relatively independent wholes, alongside the \nintroduction, the two appendixes, and the index. The authors’ endeavors to collect and \npresent in the right manner the anamnesis of the linear economy and the symptoms, \nand define the accurate descriptions of the problem(s), as well as to suggest a pivot – \nnamely solutions and an adequate therapy within the framework and in the form of the \ncircular economy – were supported by numerous individuals and institutions, first of all \nthrough the five forewords authored by the most significant names of the foundations \nand platforms for the development of the circular economy.\nAt the end of the book review, the conclusions are presented based on the material \npresented in the book in comparison with the other available literature – books, scientific \npapers, the legislation and studies. \nThe Methodology and Goal of the Paper \nThe book review is aimed at presenting the scope, structure and basic values of and the \nlessons learnt from the book entitled “The Circular Economy Handbook, Realizing the \nCircular Advantage”, published by Palgrave Macmillan at the beginning of 2020. The \npresented facts and information revealed in the book review were produced based on \nthe content analysis, perceiving and comparing the basic values of the book with the \ncurrent scientific and professional literature.\nBearing in mind the kind of the scientific paper, the research will base the scientific \nresearch methods characteristic of a book presentation (content analysis, induction, \ndeduction, case study analysis, comparison, the historical method). \nThe Paper Results with Discussion\nThe book has 350 text pages written in the Royal format with 28 schemes and figures and \n31 tables. The concept of the book is such that, through the 28 chapters organized into three \nseparate wholes, it defines the current state of environmental, social and business issues (the \n\nhttp://ea.bg.ac.rs\n603\nEconomics of Agriculture, Year 67, No. 2, 2020, (pp. 601-608), Belgrade\nfirst whole), the optimal projected state (the second whole) and offers practical solutions \nto how achieve the optimal, projected state independently of the status of companies (the \nthird whole) within the framework of the circular economy model. The book highlights \nthe economic character of the problems that used to be treated primarily (sometimes even \nexclusively, too) as environmental problems. Through the presentation of the specificities \nof different industries, the book presents the most frequent obstacles to a transformation \nfrom the ‘linear’ business doing model to the ‘circular’. The authors of the book say that \nthe aim they followed was to present to readers the points of view that would help them \nperceive how they would “scale the circular economy within their organizations and drive \ncompetitive advantage throughout their value chains.” (Lacy et al., 2020).\nThe introductory, and the first chapter at the same time  entitled “The Path to \nTransformation Is Circular” presents environment-related issues (the climate change, \na climate crisis, a devastating loss of biodiversity and the habitat, resource scarcity \netc.), addressing them as social and business issues, and indicate the general point that \nsolutions to problems lie in the understanding of the broader issues of sustainability \nand resource usage. Like the other reference authors, the authors of the book emphasize \nthe pragmatic side of the circular economy. Tonneli and Cristoni find that the circular \neconomy is the pragmatic approach that can help society change the current path of \nnatural exploitation we witness to and fear. (Tonneli, Cristoni, 2019) The authors Janić \nand Jovčić have also recently expressed a similar attitude in their research, establishing \na fact that, in the last fifteen years, the weight of discussion about the consequences of \nglobal climate changes has been changing and that the standpoint is not always connected \nwith ecology, but rather with the economy. (Janić, Jovčić, 2016) Stahel also considers \nthat the circular economy rebuilds all kinds of capital (financial, manufactured, human, \nsocial or natural) and seeks options for all organizations. (Stahel, 2019) \nThe authors emphasize the fact that only one part of the global problem will be solved \nif carbon emissions are reduced through “energy efficiency, zero-carbon production, \nand renewable energy” (Lacy et al. 2020), whereas to solve the overall problem, both \nproduction and consumption of energy must be perceived. The above-mentioned \nenvironmental, social and business issues, as well as many others (e-waste, food waste, \nplastics…) must be approached instantly, which many governments have recognized \nand accordingly have created proactive (the authors used the term ‘aggressive’) targets/\nmeasures, like those targeted by the European Union (e.g. banning cutlery and straws \nby 2021). The role of regulation bodies is recognized as important in various arias \nlike the role of the state regulatory bodies in the regulation of the food in America. \n(Ilić, et al, 2019) In their paper, Vilke et al. also recognize the EU strong response to \nthe environmental challenges like climate change, food safety, and sustainable growth. \n(Vilke et al., 2019) Different government (and not only government) policies and \nstrategies will also exert numerous influences on the economy and society. Adkins et al. \nestablish a fact of the general growth of the capital and wealth of companies and pose \nquestions about assets and a growing inequality as a result of economic and political \nstrategies. (Adkins et al., 2019)\n\n604\nhttp://ea.bg.ac.rs\nEconomics of Agriculture, Year 67, No. 2, 2020, (pp. 601-608), Belgrade\nChanges in consumer behavior and habits are also noticed; as a good example, the \nauthors mention the asset-sharing services practiced by millennials, and other \necologically conscious habits. By monitoring changes in government policies, on the \none hand, and changes in consumer behavior as well, companies increase the use of \nrecycled materials, zero waste and reusable and recyclable packaging. \nThe authors highlight the need for the general understanding of the principle(s) of \nthe circular economy independently of whether actors are consumers, i.e. citizens, \nthe government or the economy. From the point of view of the consumer, the general \ninvolvement of citizens is suggested in all sustainability aspects. A similar piece of \nadvice is also given by Petljak et al. in their research carried out in 2019, within which \nthey established a fact that, while some individual users pay attention to the symbols \nof a product packaging and opt for an ecologically sustainable packaging because they \nare motivated by care for environment and personal health, a certain number of them \nconsiders them to be unimportant. (Petljak et al., 2019) In their research study, Tešić \net al. highlight their significance when medications are in question – the medication \ninstruction that would contain all relevant information for consumers and help them \nmake a decision on buying the medication. (Tešić et al., 2010)\nThe introductory chapter further clarifies the difference from the traditional ‘linear’ \npath of doing business to the new principles of circularity, referring to the circular \neconomy as ‘a new economic system’, as well as ‘a business strategy’. The circular \neconomy as presented in the first, introductory chapter is the one that eliminates the \nconcept of waste, changing the way the economy produces and the economy and society \nconsume, which has the product of making a healthier “ecosystem that circulates value \nthroughout the economy and society.” (Lacy et al., 2020).\nThe circular economy is felt as a response to the growing needs of humankind, \nrespecting the limitedness of resources at the same time, so it is based on sustainable \ndevelopment. The circular economy is based as a concept which would enable the \nrenewal of the ecosystem, which requires a large number of innovations and changes \nin the habits of the economy and society. An important characteristic of the circular \neconomy is its orientation towards the zero-waste concept. The current attitudes of \nthe authors as Franco-García et al. (Franco-García et al., 2019) towards zero waste \nconsider this concept to be an alternative solution to waste management problems.\nIn the first thematic whole entitled “Where are We Now? – Setting the Foundation”, \nthe elaboration of the notionally introduced discipline in the introductory (first) \nchapter is presented through the two chapters of The Circular Business Models and \nDisruptive Technologies. The authors present five circular business models: Circular \nInputs, Sharing Platform, Product as a Service, Product Use Extension and Resource \nRecovery, saying that these circular models assist business in its approach to waste, \nlike “resources, capacity, lifecycles, and embedded value”. (Lacy, et al, 2020) In this \npart of the book, the authors find the following five enablers important for speeding up \nthe adoption of the principles of the circular economy, namely “consumer engagement, \n\nhttp://ea.bg.ac.rs\n605\nEconomics of Agriculture, Year 67, No. 2, 2020, (pp. 601-608), Belgrade\ndesign, reverse logistics, disruptive technologies and ecosystems.” (Lacy et al., 2020) \nThe authors underline the importance of disruptive technologies in the strike of the \ncircular economy (digital, physical, and biological technologies) and their involvement \nin enabling circular business models by increasing efficiency, innovation, data sharing, \nand a decrease in relying on resource-intensive materials.\nIn the second thematic whole entitled “Where Do We Need to Be? – Scaling Industry \nImpact”, the authors introduce 12 new chapters, of which 10 chapters present the profiles \nof the major industries in terms of waste pools, obstacles, potential opportunities etc. \nas the means of providing and learning practices that can be helpful in overcoming \nproblems in specific economic sectors. The fourth chapter of the book speaks about \nthe reason why the circular economy is a story about ten Industries. The industries \nidentified as major are as follows: Metals and Mining; Oil and Gas; ICT; Machinery and \nIndustrial equipment; Electricity; Chemical; and FMCG; Household; Fashion Industry; \nand Personal Mobility (the industry profile). In this part, the authors highlight the fact \nthat circular opportunities address the four types of linear waste: wasted resources, a \nwasted capacity, wasted lifecycles and wasted embedded values, suggesting that the \nlinear way is not the only way to create value. Apart from presenting the ten major \nindustries, this thematic whole also shows in one chapter (Fifteenth) how e-commerce \nmeets the circular economy, considering the manners in which companies can reduce \nwaste across distribution channels, offering products/services with greater revenues \netc. This chapter resolves the dilemma whether “e-commerce channels or brick-and-\nmortar stores have more substantial environmental footprints.” (Lacy et al., 2020)\nIn the third thematic whole entitled “How Do We Get There? – Making the Pivot”, the \nauthors introduce 8 new chapters, which are indicative of the necessity for synchronizing \nthe two processes, one of which is the transformation and growth of the core business, \nwhereas the other is scaling new initiatives of the circular economy, which requires the \ndefining and valorization of the main point essential for the advancement of the circular \nmaturity within the four categories holistically: Operations; Products and Services, \nCulture and Organization; and Ecosystem. \nWithin the scope of the Operations as one of the four main points, the authors suggest \nthat ‘the value lost’ should be examined through operations and with respect to energy, \nemissions, water, and waste. Within the scope of the Products and Services, change in \nthe product/service design, the lifecycle, the optimization of their usage, close product \nloops, and ultimately the elimination of waste are addressed. Within the scope of the \nCulture and Organization , the authors suggest that companies should (and must) \nintroduce the circular economy principles into the fundaments of the organization \nby making changes in their respective policies, practices and procedures. Within the \nEcosystem as the forth main point, the authors suggest that a strategic partnership should \nbe established both in the public sector and in the private sector in order to create such \nan environment that will enable them to achieve a ‘collective transformation.’ At the \nsame time, this also the final, 28th chapter of the book.\n\n606\nhttp://ea.bg.ac.rs\nEconomics of Agriculture, Year 67, No. 2, 2020, (pp. 601-608), Belgrade\nThe book poses questions and gives integral answers to them: Is it possible to bring \nglobal production and consumption systems into compliance with sustainability? Is \nit possible to create a healthier planet with business growth? Is innovating possible \nwithout linearity with the circular economy with the achievement of a competitive \nadvantage? And so on. \nIn a way similar to Lacy, Long and Spindler, other authors also contemplate the nature \nof enterprises and their complexity, the bases for the achievement of a competitive \nadvantage, innovating, etc. Ilić finds that an enterprise’s business doing is conditioned \nby the environment, and that the environment consists of all the elements (individuals, \norganizations and institutions) and factors (economic, political, legal, technological, \nsociocultural, ecological and other) that exert an influence (either real or potential) on \nthe results of the business doing of the enterprise (Ilić, 2018). In their research study \nconducted in 2019, Rajnović et al. emphasize the complexity of the company and stress \nthe obligation of a sustainable business of companies. (Rajnović et al., 2019).\nDi Mariaabe et al. (Di Mariaabe et al., 2020) also show the sustainability of the \nwaste management system imposed by the EU legislation, emphasizing the primacy \nof the integrated sustainability indicator (ISI) based on the environmental, social and \neconomic lifecycle approach in analyses.\nIn the literature list, the authors present an imposing number of 644 bibliographical \nentries, annotations and quotations, covering the content of the three thematic wholes \nand indicating the fact that the text of the book is thought-provoking and significant \nfirst of all thanks to the fact that they used scientific apparatuses, regulation and \nbusiness cases and trends (in the research study, more than 1500 circular case studies \nwere analyzed through the Circular Program Award Initiative organized by the World \nEconomic Forum). The book refers us to the practical steps that must be made so as \nto enable a linear organization to become a holistic circular organization. There are \nauthors who also considered what was needed for an organization to change its course \nof action. Gedminaitė-Raudonė et al. remind us of the fact that the circular approach \ndiffers from the traditional linear model of production, finding that the aim pursued by \nbusinesses must change from that implying generating profits of products and services \nsold to that implying generating profits from the flow of materials and products over \ntime. (Gedminaitė-Raudonė et al. 2019)\nAlthough the authors are more prone to presenting the benefits of shifting from the \nlinear to the circular economy, they also make a mention of the existence of certain \nrisks accompanying this process in organizations. In a way similar to them, Jovičić \net al. find that, when making a proposal for a new concept, such as shifting to the \ncircular economy, a series of economic and other benefits are expected in a longer \ntime period. A possible occurrence of short-term losses, however, should not be \nneglected. (Jovičić et al., 2019)\n\nhttp://ea.bg.ac.rs\n607\nEconomics of Agriculture, Year 67, No. 2, 2020, (pp. 601-608), Belgrade\nConclusions\nThe book entitled “The Circular Economy Handbook, Realizing the Circular Advantage” \npresented in this scientific book review was written in the academic style, and its value \nreflects in the demonstrated richness of the authors’ knowledge and their familiarity with \nseveral scientific fields and areas (social-humanistic sciences, interdisciplinary sciences, \nmedical sciences). The authors Peter Lacy, Jessica Long and Wesley Spindler have \ndemonstrated the ability to present the problems of climate change, waste management, \nuncontrolled growth within different scientific fields and practical current problems by \ndrawing the so-called ‘take, make, waste’ mindset that exists in society and in the economy, \nby which the general value of the text is multiplied and its dual nature – scientific and \nprofessional – is presented (i.e. its scientific and professional contribution).\nThe linear path is implicative of the mentioned ‘take, make, waste’ model, and the \nbook highlights that exactly at the moment when something is wasted – resources are \nwasted. Treating resources in nature badly is in contradiction to the basic economic \nprinciples that speak about the scarcity of resources and finding out a way/ways to use \nthem for alternative needs. The essence of the circular economy lies in the manner in \nwhich resources would be retained in the manufacturing/production and consumption \ncycles as long as possible. In that manner, the living environment is also protected by \nsaving money, resources and workforce, simultaneously with the significant savings \nthat companies would have since they would be using the already used materials.\n“The Circular Economy Handbook” shows guidance for systemic change within the holistic \napproach, referring to organizational and civil change from ‘the linear to the circular’, \nchanging business models by means of technology as well, which its practical contribution \nis based on and which is justified by the noun ‘handbook’ used in the title of the book. \nConflict of interests\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1.

The \nauthors of the presented book also wrote other books published within the framework \nof the topics of the circular economy, waste management, growth and sustainability \nissues, written on the basis of their academic and expert analyses and rich experience \nwithin the specialized of waste management, sustainability and ecology.\nWithin the part of book review entitled The Methodology and Goal of the Paper , the \nscientific goals of this review and the methodology used will be acknowledged. \nWithin the part of the book review entitled The Paper Results with Discussion , the \npresented book content will be analyzed within the existing structure of the book. The \nbook is structured into three separate and relatively independent wholes, alongside the \nintroduction, the two appendixes, and the index. The authors’ endeavors to collect and \npresent in the right manner the anamnesis of the linear economy and the symptoms, \nand define the accurate descriptions of the problem(s), as well as to suggest a pivot – \nnamely solutions and an adequate therapy within the framework and in the form of the \ncircular economy – were supported by numerous individuals and institutions, first of all \nthrough the five forewords authored by the most significant names of the foundations \nand platforms for the development of the circular economy.\nAt the end of the book review, the conclusions are presented based on the material \npresented in the book in comparison with the other available literature – books, scientific \npapers, the legislation and studies. \nThe Methodology and Goal of the Paper \nThe book review is aimed at presenting the scope, structure and basic values of and the \nlessons learnt from the book entitled “The Circular Economy Handbook, Realizing the \nCircular Advantage”, published by Palgrave Macmillan at the beginning of 2020. The \npresented facts and information revealed in the book review were produced based on \nthe content analysis, perceiving and comparing the basic values of the book with the \ncurrent scientific and professional literature.\nBearing in mind the kind of the scientific paper, the research will base the scientific \nresearch methods characteristic of a book presentation (content analysis, induction, \ndeduction, case study analysis, comparison, the historical method). \nThe Paper Results with Discussion\nThe book has 350 text pages written in the Royal format with 28 schemes and figures and \n31 tables. The concept of the book is such that, through the 28 chapters organized into three \nseparate wholes, it defines the current state of environmental, social and business issues (the ",

The book highlights \nthe economic character of the problems that used to be treated primarily (sometimes even \nexclusively, too) as environmental problems. Through the presentation of the specificities \nof different industries, the book presents the most frequent obstacles to a transformation \nfrom the ‘linear’ business doing model to the ‘circular’. The authors of the book say that \nthe aim they followed was to present to readers the points of view that would help them \nperceive how they would “scale the circular economy within their organizations and drive \ncompetitive advantage throughout their value chains.” (Lacy et al., 2020).\nThe introductory, and the first chapter at the same time  entitled “The Path to \nTransformation Is Circular” presents environment-related issues (the climate change, \na climate crisis, a devastating loss of biodiversity and the habitat, resource scarcity \netc.), addressing them as social and business issues, and indicate the general point that \nsolutions to problems lie in the understanding of the broader issues of sustainability \nand resource usage. Like the other reference authors, the authors of the book emphasize \nthe pragmatic side of the circular economy. Tonneli and Cristoni find that the circular \neconomy is the pragmatic approach that can help society change the current path of \nnatural exploitation we witness to and fear. (Tonneli, Cristoni, 2019) The authors Janić \nand Jovčić have also recently expressed a similar attitude in their research, establishing \na fact that, in the last fifteen years, the weight of discussion about the consequences of \nglobal climate changes has been changing and that the standpoint is not always connected \nwith ecology, but rather with the economy. (Janić, Jovčić, 2016) Stahel also considers \nthat the circular economy rebuilds all kinds of capital (financial, manufactured, human, \nsocial or natural) and seeks options for all organizations. (Stahel, 2019) \nThe authors emphasize the fact that only one part of the global problem will be solved \nif carbon emissions are reduced through “energy efficiency, zero-carbon production, \nand renewable energy” (Lacy et al. 2020), whereas to solve the overall problem, both \nproduction and consumption of energy must be perceived. The above-mentioned \nenvironmental, social and business issues, as well as many others (e-waste, food waste, \nplastics…) must be approached instantly, which many governments have recognized \nand accordingly have created proactive (the authors used the term ‘aggressive’) targets/\nmeasures, like those targeted by the European Union (e.g. banning cutlery and straws \nby 2021). The role of regulation bodies is recognized as important in various arias \nlike the role of the state regulatory bodies in the regulation of the food in America. \n(Ilić, et al, 2019) In their paper, Vilke et al. also recognize the EU strong response to \nthe environmental challenges like climate change, food safety, and sustainable growth. \n(Vilke et al., 2019) Different government (and not only government) policies and \nstrategies will also exert numerous influences on the economy and society. Adkins et al. \nestablish a fact of the general growth of the capital and wealth of companies and pose \nquestions about assets and a growing inequality as a result of economic and political \nstrategies.

By monitoring changes in government policies, on the \none hand, and changes in consumer behavior as well, companies increase the use of \nrecycled materials, zero waste and reusable and recyclable packaging. \nThe authors highlight the need for the general understanding of the principle(s) of \nthe circular economy independently of whether actors are consumers, i.e. citizens, \nthe government or the economy. From the point of view of the consumer, the general \ninvolvement of citizens is suggested in all sustainability aspects. A similar piece of \nadvice is also given by Petljak et al. in their research carried out in 2019, within which \nthey established a fact that, while some individual users pay attention to the symbols \nof a product packaging and opt for an ecologically sustainable packaging because they \nare motivated by care for environment and personal health, a certain number of them \nconsiders them to be unimportant. (Petljak et al., 2019) In their research study, Tešić \net al. highlight their significance when medications are in question – the medication \ninstruction that would contain all relevant information for consumers and help them \nmake a decision on buying the medication. (Tešić et al., 2010)\nThe introductory chapter further clarifies the difference from the traditional ‘linear’ \npath of doing business to the new principles of circularity, referring to the circular \neconomy as ‘a new economic system’, as well as ‘a business strategy’. The circular \neconomy as presented in the first, introductory chapter is the one that eliminates the \nconcept of waste, changing the way the economy produces and the economy and society \nconsume, which has the product of making a healthier “ecosystem that circulates value \nthroughout the economy and society.” (Lacy et al., 2020).\nThe circular economy is felt as a response to the growing needs of humankind, \nrespecting the limitedness of resources at the same time, so it is based on sustainable \ndevelopment. The circular economy is based as a concept which would enable the \nrenewal of the ecosystem, which requires a large number of innovations and changes \nin the habits of the economy and society. An important characteristic of the circular \neconomy is its orientation towards the zero-waste concept. The current attitudes of \nthe authors as Franco-García et al. (Franco-García et al., 2019) towards zero waste \nconsider this concept to be an alternative solution to waste management problems.\nIn the first thematic whole entitled “Where are We Now? – Setting the Foundation”, \nthe elaboration of the notionally introduced discipline in the introductory (first) \nchapter is presented through the two chapters of The Circular Business Models and \nDisruptive Technologies. The authors present five circular business models: Circular \nInputs, Sharing Platform, Product as a Service, Product Use Extension and Resource \nRecovery, saying that these circular models assist business in its approach to waste, \nlike “resources, capacity, lifecycles, and embedded value”. (Lacy, et al, 2020) In this \npart of the book, the authors find the following five enablers important for speeding up \nthe adoption of the principles of the circular economy, namely “consumer engagement, ",

The fourth chapter of the book speaks about \nthe reason why the circular economy is a story about ten Industries. The industries \nidentified as major are as follows: Metals and Mining; Oil and Gas; ICT; Machinery and \nIndustrial equipment; Electricity; Chemical; and FMCG; Household; Fashion Industry; \nand Personal Mobility (the industry profile). In this part, the authors highlight the fact \nthat circular opportunities address the four types of linear waste: wasted resources, a \nwasted capacity, wasted lifecycles and wasted embedded values, suggesting that the \nlinear way is not the only way to create value. Apart from presenting the ten major \nindustries, this thematic whole also shows in one chapter (Fifteenth) how e-commerce \nmeets the circular economy, considering the manners in which companies can reduce \nwaste across distribution channels, offering products/services with greater revenues \netc. This chapter resolves the dilemma whether “e-commerce channels or brick-and-\nmortar stores have more substantial environmental footprints.” (Lacy et al., 2020)\nIn the third thematic whole entitled “How Do We Get There? – Making the Pivot”, the \nauthors introduce 8 new chapters, which are indicative of the necessity for synchronizing \nthe two processes, one of which is the transformation and growth of the core business, \nwhereas the other is scaling new initiatives of the circular economy, which requires the \ndefining and valorization of the main point essential for the advancement of the circular \nmaturity within the four categories holistically: Operations; Products and Services, \nCulture and Organization; and Ecosystem. \nWithin the scope of the Operations as one of the four main points, the authors suggest \nthat ‘the value lost’ should be examined through operations and with respect to energy, \nemissions, water, and waste. Within the scope of the Products and Services, change in \nthe product/service design, the lifecycle, the optimization of their usage, close product \nloops, and ultimately the elimination of waste are addressed. Within the scope of the \nCulture and Organization , the authors suggest that companies should (and must) \nintroduce the circular economy principles into the fundaments of the organization \nby making changes in their respective policies, practices and procedures. Within the \nEcosystem as the forth main point, the authors suggest that a strategic partnership should \nbe established both in the public sector and in the private sector in order to create such \nan environment that will enable them to achieve a ‘collective transformation.’ At the \nsame time, this also the final, 28th chapter of the book.",

Is \nit possible to create a healthier planet with business growth? Is innovating possible \nwithout linearity with the circular economy with the achievement of a competitive \nadvantage? And so on. \nIn a way similar to Lacy, Long and Spindler, other authors also contemplate the nature \nof enterprises and their complexity, the bases for the achievement of a competitive \nadvantage, innovating, etc. Ilić finds that an enterprise’s business doing is conditioned \nby the environment, and that the environment consists of all the elements (individuals, \norganizations and institutions) and factors (economic, political, legal, technological, \nsociocultural, ecological and other) that exert an influence (either real or potential) on \nthe results of the business doing of the enterprise (Ilić, 2018). In their research study \nconducted in 2019, Rajnović et al. emphasize the complexity of the company and stress \nthe obligation of a sustainable business of companies. (Rajnović et al., 2019).\nDi Mariaabe et al. (Di Mariaabe et al., 2020) also show the sustainability of the \nwaste management system imposed by the EU legislation, emphasizing the primacy \nof the integrated sustainability indicator (ISI) based on the environmental, social and \neconomic lifecycle approach in analyses.\nIn the literature list, the authors present an imposing number of 644 bibliographical \nentries, annotations and quotations, covering the content of the three thematic wholes \nand indicating the fact that the text of the book is thought-provoking and significant \nfirst of all thanks to the fact that they used scientific apparatuses, regulation and \nbusiness cases and trends (in the research study, more than 1500 circular case studies \nwere analyzed through the Circular Program Award Initiative organized by the World \nEconomic Forum). The book refers us to the practical steps that must be made so as \nto enable a linear organization to become a holistic circular organization. There are \nauthors who also considered what was needed for an organization to change its course \nof action. Gedminaitė-Raudonė et al. remind us of the fact that the circular approach \ndiffers from the traditional linear model of production, finding that the aim pursued by \nbusinesses must change from that implying generating profits of products and services \nsold to that implying generating profits from the flow of materials and products over \ntime. (Gedminaitė-Raudonė et al. 2019)\nAlthough the authors are more prone to presenting the benefits of shifting from the \nlinear to the circular economy, they also make a mention of the existence of certain \nrisks accompanying this process in organizations. In a way similar to them, Jovičić \net al. find that, when making a proposal for a new concept, such as shifting to the \ncircular economy, a series of economic and other benefits are expected in a longer \ntime period. A possible occurrence of short-term losses, however, should not be \nneglected. (Jovičić et al., 2019)",

The authors Peter Lacy, Jessica Long and Wesley Spindler have \ndemonstrated the ability to present the problems of climate change, waste management, \nuncontrolled growth within different scientific fields and practical current problems by \ndrawing the so-called ‘take, make, waste’ mindset that exists in society and in the economy, \nby which the general value of the text is multiplied and its dual nature – scientific and \nprofessional – is presented (i.e. its scientific and professional contribution).\nThe linear path is implicative of the mentioned ‘take, make, waste’ model, and the \nbook highlights that exactly at the moment when something is wasted – resources are \nwasted. Treating resources in nature badly is in contradiction to the basic economic \nprinciples that speak about the scarcity of resources and finding out a way/ways to use \nthem for alternative needs. The essence of the circular economy lies in the manner in \nwhich resources would be retained in the manufacturing/production and consumption \ncycles as long as possible. In that manner, the living environment is also protected by \nsaving money, resources and workforce, simultaneously with the significant savings \nthat companies would have since they would be using the already used materials.\n“The Circular Economy Handbook” shows guidance for systemic change within the holistic \napproach, referring to organizational and civil change from ‘the linear to the circular’, \nchanging business models by means of technology as well, which its practical contribution \nis based on and which is justified by the noun ‘handbook’ used in the title of the book. \nConflict of interests\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1.
