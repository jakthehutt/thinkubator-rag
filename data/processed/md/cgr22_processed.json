Our vision \nis an economic system that ensures the \nplanet and all people can thrive.  \n \nTo avoid climate breakdown, our goal is  \nto double global circularity by 2032.\nThis report is published as an affiliate project of the Platform for Accelerating the \nCircular Economy (PACE). PACE is a global community of leaders, across business, \ngovernment and civil society, working together to develop a collective agenda \nand drive ambitious action to accelerate the transition to a circular economy.  \nIt was initiated at the World Economic Forum and is currently hosted by the  \nWorld Resources Institute.\nBEHIND THE COVER\nThe image we chose to mark our fifth edition is an organic, regenerative  \nand fundamental material: wood. The unique gains and rings that mark each \npiece represent an untold history—shaped by the climate the tree has grown in.  \nThese ripples of impact remind us of the inherent connection between  \nnature and climate—and the lasting impression a changed climate will  \nhave on our world.\n\nIN SUPPORT  OF THE\nCIRCULARITY GAP REPORT\nJULES KORTENHORST\nCEO at Rocky  \nMountain Institute \n‘We have less than ten years to mitigate the worst impacts \nof climate change. Using metrics to gauge our progress in \naddressing the climate crisis is crucial. The metrics- and \ndata-driven approach that the Circularity Gap Reports have \npioneered over the past five years has been significant in \nadvancing circular metrics—but we need to go further. We \nlook forward to collaborating and sharing knowledge on this \ntopic to help us reach our 1.5-degree goal.’\nDAVID MCGINTY\nGlobal Director at the Platform \nfor Accelerating the Circular \nEconomy (PACE)\n‘The triple planetary crisis—climate, nature and  \npollution—along with the need for greater equity and \nstability—are why circular action at scale is critical now.  \nThe Circularity Gap Report continues to be an invaluable  \ntool for measuring progress towards global circularity.  \nAs PACE leaders aim to double global circularity by 2032,  \nwe are committed to continuing to enhance the data,  \ninsights and metrics required to champion and deliver  \nthe urgent actions needed.’\nJANEZ POTOČNIK\nCo-Chair at the International \nResource Panel of the \nUnited Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP)\n‘The circular economy was not on the European policy agenda \nfor a long time. From the beginning, the Circularity Gap Report  \naccompanied policy efforts to raise attention to the circular \neconomy. The reports show us a reflection of what we need \nto see in implementing the circular economy: the path from \nwords to deeds is a real challenge, which demands our focus.’\nFEIKE SIJBESMA\nClimate Advocate  \nand Honorary Chairman  \nat Royal DSM\n‘Scarcity of resources is largely a result of omissions and \nmistakes in the design and use of value chains.

This edition reinforces \nkey findings from five years of analysis and lays out actions \nthat companies can take to drive transformative change. \nWidespread adoption of circular strategies across all sectors \nand value chains are needed to tackle the three most \npressing challenges of the climate crisis, nature loss  \nand mounting inequality.’\nKATE RAWORTH\nAuthor of Doughnut Economics \nand Senior Teaching Associate  \nat the Environmental Change \nInstitute, University of Oxford\n‘It’s clear—we must act now! There’s no time to lose. By \napplying the circular solutions outlined in this report, we \ncan reduce the use of scarce materials and dramatically cut \nemissions—thereby fighting climate change and biodiversity \nloss. But we can only do it by joining forces. That’s why I’m \ncalling on all CEOs and business leaders, governments and \nNGOs to step up and accelerate our combined efforts, so we \ncan reach the goal of doubling circularity within ten years.  \nLet’s take bold actions and deliver impact.’\n‘Preventing and reducing resource use and reusing materials \nin a global circular economy are key strategies to protect \nthe Earth’s environment, as well as its capacity to provide \nfor current and future generations. A variety of metrics are \nneeded to understand progress alongside valuable data, \nanalysis, guidance and examples.

This iteration \nmarks the fifth edition. The Reports provide high-\nlevel insights into the globe’s material flows and \nkey levers for transitioning to circularity. They also \nsupport decision-makers with clear metrics, global \ndata and a measurement of the circular economy to \nguide their action. \nUpdating the Circularity Metric is not feasible on an \nannual basis, however, due to the limited availability \nof data. Since 2020, the Circularity Gap Reporting \nInitiative has also explored the role of data in the \ncircular transition: how to collect it, communicate it \nand make it globally accessible. \nTo contact us and to access interactive visuals and \ndeep dives into our findings, please visit:  \ncircularity-gap.world\n5\nTH\n7\nThe Circularity Gap Report  20226\n\n\nThe harsh reality is that between Paris and \nGlasgow, more than half a trillion tonnes of virgin \nmaterials were consumed. Also, the Circularity \nGap got worse, not better. In the six years between \nheadline-grabbing climate conferences, the global \neconomy consumed 70% more than what the Earth can \nsafely replenish.* This cannot continue—we only have \none planet. While the 2015 Paris Agreement upped \nthe global ambition with an agreement on binding \nclimate commitments, COP26 in Glasgow was a ‘fragile \nwin’ for the climate—in the words of COP26 President \nAlok Sharma. Progress was, however, made on three \nfronts: recognition of the need to put an end to fossil \nfuels; setting new rules for carbon markets, and some \nheadway on a mechanism for richer nations to pay \nfor their historical contributions to climate change. \nBut there is still much to be done, making the World \nEconomic Forum in Davos a key moment to advance \nthe agenda ahead of COP27 in Egypt at the end of \n2022. \nFive years of Circularity Gap Reports have revealed \nhow linear the world is—we only cycle 8.6% of what \nwe use, which leaves a massive Circularity Gap of \nover 90%. And in only two years, global circularity \nwilted from 9.1% in 2018 to 8.6% in 2020. As a result, \nthe wrong kinds of records are getting broken and \nset. In 2019, for instance, as well as the world having \nwarmed 1.1-degrees since the pre-industrial era, \nsociety also breached boundaries for extraction, \nconsuming 100 billion tonnes of resources. Our \nanalysis connected this resource use to key societal \nneeds and wants—how we eat, move and live—so \nthat we could quantitatively track trends in usage \nand waste. This allows us to develop people-centred, \nresource-smart and climate-safe roadmaps for change.  \nFinally, the tectonic plates of international climate \naction are visibly shifting—although slowly. It is \nalready 50 years since the landmark Club of Rome \nreport warned of the dangers of natural resource-\nuse and endless economic growth; ten years since \nthe circular economy moved from the fringes to \nthe mainstream—yet remaining far from being \nthe norm—and five years since the first Circularity \nGap Report  gave us a trackable figure for global \nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\ncircularity. Time is not on our side, but momentum \nis with us. Hot on the heels of COP26, both business \nand public interest in climate action is high, despite \nthe world still experiencing the compound effects \nof a pandemic. There is also a valuable storehouse \nof transferable knowledge out there, backed up by \nexamples of inspiring best practices. So, to achieve \nthe transformation needed, progress both needs to \naccelerate and scale. We need regenerative and ethical \nbehaviour to become the norm, over extractive and \nexploitative practices.\nThe world may feel like it’s on fire, but here’s the \nsolution: enacted globally, a circular economy can \nhelp to close the Emissions Gap. This Circularity Gap \nReport 2022  will demonstrate—based on five years of \nanalysis and learnings—how the circular economy is \na means to cut resource-use and emissions and boost \nequitable societies. With our roadmap of 21 circular \nsolutions, businesses, cities and nations can reduce \nresource extraction and use by 28%, therefore cutting \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 39% and getting the \nworld on a 1.5-degree pathway. Tailoring the roadmap \nto different localities and sectors can guide all key \nactors in the course corrections we so desperately \nneed. Whilst our roadmap is a powerful addition to \nthe clean-energy transition already underway, we \nwon’t achieve the scale of change needed unless we \nalso drop business as usual behaviours and overcome \nlinear thinking. In this iteration of the Report, we \ninvestigate these obstacles, plus showcase real-world \nexamples of circular activity.\n \nLet’s work together to close the Circularity Gap, \nfast and for everyone. It is time for collective action \nto reset our economy and begin to erase social \ninequalities. In some places, this is already happening, \nbut it must become the norm, everywhere. So, \nas promises of environmental action flow in from \ncountries around the world post-COP and attention \nturns to updating national climate pledges for COP27, \ncircularity must be heavily featured. It carries the \nsolutions countries and businesses need to meet their \nclimate goals, safeguard the Earth’s resources and \nprotect all people. It’s time for a circular economy.  \nIn only six years, the global economy consumed an \nadditional half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials, \nnamely minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass.  \nThese enormous volumes of materials—by and \nlarge wasted after use— are climbing year on year. \nUltimately, waste is connected to most environmental \nproblems, from biodiversity loss, global warming and \nair pollution to plastic soup.\nIn only 50 years, global use of materials has nearly \nquadrupled—outpacing population growth. 1 In 1972, \nas the Club of Rome’s report Limits to Growth was \npublished, the world consumed 28.6 billion tonnes.  \nBy 2000, this had gone up to 54.9 billion tonnes and  \nas of 2019, it surpassed 100 billion tonnes.  \nRising waste levels are accompanying the rapid \nacceleration of consumption: ultimately, over 90% of \nall materials extracted and used are wasted.  \n20502000 2015\n 2021\n1972\n28.6 Gt\n54.9 Gt\n89.9 Gt\n101.4 Gt\n170 Gt\n184 Gt\n93 Gt\nClub of Rome:\nLimits to Growth\nTurn of the\nmillenium\nCOP21 - Paris\nCOP26 - Glasgow\nBetween Paris\nand Glasgow,\nmore than\nhalf a trillion\ntonnes of virgin\nmaterials\nwere consumed.\nProjected\nWith business\nas usual, material\nextraction is\nprojected to surpass\nbetween 170 Gt and\n184 Gt by 2050.\nM a te rial e x tra ction  in billio n  to n nes (G t)\nOr, on the flip side, only 8.6% make it back into our \neconomy. This rate of extraction continues to threaten \nthe planet’s future—and our lives on it.

We are \nliving in a time of rampant pollution and waste, \nresource scarcity, biodiversity loss and warming \nglobal temperatures: all of which are linked in \nsome way to our rising levels of consumption. A \nsocial and economic system that has this impact \non its natural environment cannot be called a \nhealthy one. In the past year alone, a cascade of \nalarming environmental events swept the globe, \nfrom wildfires and storms to floods and droughts. \nWithout action, climate breakdown could displace \nhundreds of million people by 2050 3 and result in \na catastrophic loss of biodiversity. The sixth IPCC \nreport 4 definitively stated—for the first time—that \nclimate change is driven by us: human activity got \nus here. But it can also get us out—the solution is in \nour hands. It’s been five years since our Circularity \nGap Report first calculated the circular state of \nthe world. In this short time, the world has gone \nfrom 9.1% circular in 2018 to 8.6% in 2020, annual \nglobal resource use has surpassed 100 billion tonnes \nand inequalities have widened across and within \ncountries—and it is now over 1-degree warmer than \nin pre-industrial times. We’ve done the maths; now \nit’s time to examine our key findings and implement \nsolutions that can guide businesses, cities and \nnations in becoming more circular. This way, they \ncan reach the ultimate goal of contributing to a \nsocially just and ecologically safe space. This edition \ndraws on five years of knowledge to show the power \nof the circular economy to equitably fulfil our global \nneeds and wants, but with radically fewer materials \nand emissions. There is no time to lose.\n50 years since the Club of Rome warning,  \nten years of circular economy moving towards \nthe mainstream and five years  \nof the Circularity Gap Report .\nAs society has extracted and consumed the Earth’s \nnatural resources at alarming rates—tripling in the last \nhalf century—warning calls have surfaced repeatedly. \nFifty years ago the Club of Rome’s landmark book Limits \nto Growth  predicted that rapid economic growth and \nnatural resource exploitation would lead to the ‘collapse \nof civilisation’ by 2040. 5 And new research 6 shows that \nwe appear to be, unfortunately, right on schedule. A \nhandful of the study’s ‘worst-case scenarios’ based on \nfood production and pollution, among others, have \naccurately forecasted our real-world situation. The new \nconclusions appear to confirm that we only have the \nnext decade to change course.\nPhoto by Max Ravier\nIn the years since the Limits to Growth predictions, we \nhave seen tremendous progress on the sustainability \nor ‘green’ front with a medley of environmental \nvictories. However, we can’t downplay our defeats. \nTake the Paris Agreement, a great example of globally-\ncoordinated action on climate breakdown. In 2015, \nnearly all countries pledged to limit the average global \ntemperature rise this century to well below 2-degrees \nin an effort to prevent the worst impacts of climate \nbreakdown, provide support for lower-income nations \nand be transparent in reporting on action. Things \ncould only get better—or so was the presumption. It is \nnow clear, though, that the blueprints mapped out for \nthe globe in the form of national climate promises—\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—were \nnever powerful enough to fulfil the Agreement’s goal \nof limiting warming temperatures to safe levels. Next \nto this, the funding pledged to lower-income nations \nwas staggeringly slow and low. Many pinned their \nhopes on COP26 in Glasgow to deliver meaningful \nimpacts, but outcomes were branded a ‘fragile \nwin’ by COP President Alok Sharma. While the 2015 \nParis Agreement upped the global ambition with an \nagreement on binding climate commitments, Glasgow \nfailed to deliver on its ultimate target: firmly closing \nthe gap to 1.5-degree with the same level of binding \nagreements. It did, however, reduce the Emissions Gap \nas some countries boosted their NDCs: now to meet \n1.5-degrees between 19 and 23 billion tonnes of CO 2 \nequivalents must be removed from the atmosphere, \naccording to Climate Action Tracker. The conference \nalso delivered a breakthrough agreement on phasing \nout fossil fuels and commitment to a just transition, it \ndemonstrated great business leadership and published \na range of pledges that will affect the private sector \nfor years to come. It also set rules for carbon markets \nthat could unlock trillions of dollars in climate finance \nto protect forests, build renewable energy facilities \nand more. It, however, once again underperformed on \nramping up finance to lower-income nations—among \nother disappointments.  \nAnalysis shows that even if all original NDCs were \nfulfilled, the world would still warm up by 3.2-degrees \nthis century  7 and if we include all the updates ahead \nof COP26, the world would be on track for 2.4-degree \nwarming this century. This is partly because they \noverwhelmingly focus on the energy transition: \nditching fossil fuels in favour of clean energy, such as \nsolar or wind. Entering COP26, only one-third of all \nnations had any mention of the circular economy in \ntheir pledges, less than 40% included any plans for \n1\n13\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n\npaths. Dedicated territory-specific Reports have been \nproduced for Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, and the \nprovince of Quebec—with many more to come. It has \nalso gained impressive traction in the corporate world, \nwith recognised global business leaders endorsing \nthe Reports, such as the CEO of Phillips, and it has \nencouraged a range international companies—from \nconstruction company Rockwool to Europe-wide retailer \nAction—to understand their role in value chains and \nclose their own Circularity Gaps. \nTHE CIRCULAR TRANSITION MUST  \nLOOK BEYOND ITS IMPACT ON RESOURCE \nUSE ALONE\nIn our modern world of interconnected flows across \nborders and rising inequalities, the circular transition \nmust adapt, looking beyond resource use and efficiency \nalone. For a balanced outcome, it must examine its \nlinks with wider environmental issues and social equity. \nResource use is enmeshed with GHG emissions—making \nthe circular economy a powerful tool to cut emissions \nand combat climate breakdown (see more in Chapter \nThree). It is also a multistakeholder model and its \nsystems-thinking approach boosts capacity, cooperation \nand capability to serve universal societal needs. And \nif done well, it can work to reduce inequalities in the \nprocess. It acts as a framework that supports a more \nresource-smart, people-centric future. That is why in \nour five years of the Circularity Gap Report , our focus has \nmirrored this shift: we quantitatively tied the circular \neconomy to GHG emissions and analysed how circular \nstrategies can help countries serve the needs of their \ncitizens in equitable and sustainable ways (see more in  \nChapter Four). \nFrom circular, to linear and back again:  \nthe Earth’s journey.\nFrom the four seasons to day becoming night, our \nplanet Earth functions in a naturally circular manner—\nand has done so for billions of years. In nature, there \nis no waste: all materials have value and are used to \nsustain life in a myriad of ways. Natural processes are \nrun from renewable energy: the oak tree, for example, \nconsumes sunlight to create sugar, which allows acorns \nto grow—precious food for squirrels. The discarded \nacorn casings then become nutrients for decomposers, \nsuch as worms, which turn them into soil. Even as our \nhuman ancestors arrived on the planet, most of their \nactivities were driven by muscle power: be it human \nor animal. Growing or sourcing materials, and building \ntraining to support their implementation and now the \nupdated Pact continues the overwhelming focus on \ncutting fossil fuels—namely coal—as the primary means \nto cut emissions. This results in efforts centred solely on \nenergy sources in industries with high greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions: namely electricity, heat, construction, \ntransportation and manufacturing. Although vital, is this \nalone enough to stem climate breakdown? The answer \nhere is no. We need to explore truly sustainable and \ntransformative alternatives with a wider, more holistic \nimpact to accompany the clean energy transition—that \nalso targets our rising consumption levels and considers \ntraining people to support the transition. Egypt is due \nto host COP27 in late 2022. Governments must ensure it \ndoes better than COP26.\nTEN YEARS SINCE THE CIRCULAR\nECONOMY MOVED TO BECOMING\nMORE IN THE MAINSTREAM\nThe circular economy is nature’s equivalent of ‘living \nwithin your means.’  Just as living beyond your economic \nmeans can be risky and lead to problems in how you are \nable to operate day to day, living beyond our planetary \nmeans is threatening the planet and how safely it can \nfunction. The circular economy is an alternative: an \napproach for living within the means of our planet, \nwhile still providing for the global population. It does \nthis by putting forward strategies that we can use to \nfulfil societies’ needs with radically fewer materials and \nemissions (see more on page 17). Despite a rich history \nacross nations and sectors of society, the circular \neconomy only moved from the fringes of academic \nthought and emerged in mainstream policy discourse \nabout ten years ago. It became a complementary model \nto traditional sustainability paradigms, with its more \nsystemic approach: suited to driving change on a large, \nglobal scale. It has also been embraced by businesses as \na means to reach climate and sustainability targets.\nChina’s Circular Economy Promotion Law  in 2008 and \nthe European Commission’s Circular Economy Action \nPlan in 2015 proved particularly noteworthy early \nmilestones. They triggered a flourish of research and \naction and introduced the circular economy to the \nworld’s two largest economies—together accounting \nfor 35% of global GDP and 25% of the global population. \nBusiness engagement has been another determining \ncharacteristic of these last ten years. The Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation’s pioneering reports, including a \nmuch-cited claim of net annual benefits of €1.8 trillion \nin the EU alone, 8 were a major spark for the uptake \nof circular strategies among businesses. Also, in the \nlong-term, a global circular economy that bypasses \nrisks inherent in the linear economy—such as supply \nchain collapse and a failure to innovate in the face of \nnew laws or regulations—would amass more profits. 9 \nThe parameters of the circular economy now feature \nin multiple governmental and multilateral policies \nand goals: from the EU Green Deal  and the EU Circular \nEconomy Action Plan , to the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs). It is also front and centre for many \nsustainability-focused business-led coalitions, such as \nthe New Plastics Economy and the Capital Equipment \nCoalition, among many others. The circular economy \nis also now increasingly coupled with resilience in calls \nfor ‘building back better’ since the onset of the covid-19 \npandemic.\nFIVE YEARS OF THE CIRCULARITY GAP \nREPORT : MEASURING WHAT MATTERS\nAs the circular economy increasingly moved into the \nmainstream, we at Circle Economy saw that something \nwas missing: measurements and metrics.  Measuring \nthe mass of global consumption—the world’s material \nfootprint—is the DNA of the  Circularity Gap Reports . The \nfirst-ever report in 2018 launched the alarming statistic \nthat the globe was only 9.1% circular—with a Circularity \nGap of 90.9%. 10 Our analysis showed the world which \nsocietal needs and wants—from Nutrition to Housing to \nMobility—consume which resources (see more on page \n19). Our x-ray of global material use (see pages 22-23) \nillustrates what happens to products and materials after \nthey have been used. In particular, it uncovers the tiny \nflow of resources cycled back into the economy—now \nonly 8.6%—and helps us estimate how much material \nis wasted beyond recovery. This exposes how deeply \nour linear system is still ingrained in our daily lives. \nThe graphic visualisation has been adopted by many \nmainstream outlets, such as National Geographic, \nThe New Scientist and the UN’s Global Environmental \nOutlook for Business—to illustrate the severity of our \nsituation.\nThe Circularity Metric filled a critical space in the circular \neconomy discourse at the time: answering the need for \nmeasurement. Capturing the circularity of the world in \none number allowed us to track and target performance \nand identify the key global levers for systemic change, \nthereby providing guidance for future action. The \nCircularity Gap Report for nations was born and a host of \ncountries have since embarked on a journey to measure \ntheir circularity, identifying their most impactful \nand transporting products, required hard labour. For \nthis reason, produced goods were extremely valuable \nand circular economy practices such as reuse were \ncommonplace. Even ceramics, made from clay and \ntherefore available in abundance, were frequently \nrecycled, food leftovers and agricultural residues were \nused to fertilise crops, excrement to tan leather, and \nurine to dye fabrics. 11 For the most part, early human \nsocieties’ existence hinged on careful resource use and \nmanagement—necessitating respect for the natural \nenvironment. Some societies today still use traditional, \nand inherently circular, practices: but the majority \nof the world has pivoted far away. Enter the linear \neconomy.\nA LINEAR ECONOMY: FROM SCARCITY  \nTO ABUNDANCE; MUSCLE POWER TO \nMACHINE POWER\nIn some parts of the world, the Industrial Revolution \nbegan around the 18th century. From 1750 to 1953, \nworld manufacturing output increased 24-fold 12—\nbut this growth was concentrated in a few locations, \nprimarily empire-building nations located in Europe, \nas well as the US. These counties swiftly traded out \nmuscle power for machines, which allowed for goods \nto be mass-produced, from the sewing machine to \nrailroad equipment. These products were then shipped \naround the world, in a process powered by fossil fuels. \nAs industrialisation spread, colonies overseas became \nthe markets for new products—but were also heavily \nexploited for raw materials to feed further production. \nEconomic growth in such countries was also impeded \nas imperial powers stifled competition; Portugal, for \nexample, banned most cloth manufacturing in colonial \nBrazil for decades in the late 18th century 13—just one \nof many examples of how social inequalities grew in \ntandem with environmental degradation. Over this \nperiod, the use of natural resources, including fossil \nfuels, increased tremendously and has continued to \nincrease at an exponential rate.\nNow and for the past 200 years, the hallmark of global \nconsumption and resource-use can be aptly described \nas ‘take-make-waste’: a linear economy. The end of \ncolonisation and its stifling policies in the 19th century \nmeant a wider range of countries, from China to Brazil \nand India, could undertake industrial schemes and \nalso rapidly begin using fossil fuels to boost their \neconomies and scale their production.  \n2\n15\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n14\n\n\nThe world’s mission was to produce more and grow \neconomically, and for consumers to consume.  \nIn feeding our hungry appetites we have stripped \nthe Earth of life-sustaining systems such as forests, \nhealthy oceans, rich soil and clean air and replaced \nthem with swathes of monocultured land and concrete \njungles. Whilst the linear economic model has enabled \nvast growth and rising wealth across many parts of \nthe world, basic living standards remain unmet in \nothers. Now, in many parts of the world, much of our \nconsumption has become unrelated to meeting  \nhuman needs. 14\nGrowth in consumption was also inevitably tied to \nwaste. As the linear economy began to take hold, \nplanned obsolescence that artificially shortens \nproducts’ lifespans became commonplace from the \n1930s onwards, leading to a peak in consumer waste \ngeneration. 15 Recycling, which experienced a ‘golden \nage’ more than 130 years ago, decreased pre-World \nWar I and didn’t return to full force until the 1990s: 16  \nIt wasn’t only consumerism spiralling, but also rubbish \ngoing to landfill. And what’s more, our analysis found \nthat between the 19th and 21st centuries, global \nresource use climbed from 7 billion tonnes a year to \nover 100 billion tonnes.\nLET’S FAST-FORWARD TO THE  \nPRESENT: 2022\nIn the past half-century, the world’s population has \nmore than doubled, 17 yet the amount of material \nflowing through the economy has more than tripled, \nfrom 27 billion tonnes in 1970 to 84 billion tonnes in \n2015.18 And in 2021, we reached a worrying milestone: \nthe mass of human-made things, from pavements \nto apartments to phones, was found to outweigh all \nliving beings and biomass, such as our oceans, trees \nand animals. 19 Artificial objects have gone from just 3% \nof the world’s biomass in 1900 to on par with it today. \nOur use of natural resources to make more ‘stuff’ is not \npredicted to slow down and looks set to increase from \n100 to between 170 and 184 billion tonnes by 2050. \nThe events of 2020 also served to hold a magnifying \nglass to the flaws in our system as the covid-19 \npandemic swept the world. It exposed our linear \neconomy as extremely vulnerable to shocks. Yet it \nalso served to show how fast changes can occur in \ntimes of crisis:  governments were admirably swift in \nresponding with safety nets of huge proportions for \npeople’s welfare, jobs and health.  \nYet governments have failed to use this global event \nas an opportunity to pivot to a system where societal \nand environmental health is prioritised over economic \ngrowth. A United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) report confirmed that of the $14.6 trillion \nspent on preventing economic collapse during the \npandemic, a huge portion went toward bail-outs for \npolluting industries, such as oil and airlines. 20 It was \ndisappointing that no green conditions were attached \nto the financial support, which could have encouraged \naction toward net-zero emission targets or investment \nin long-term technological development. And now, \ndespite GHG emissions dropping by 6% during the \npandemic, they were projected to exceed 2019 levels \nin 2020 by 4% across the G20 as fossil-fuel use spirals \nupward—despite governments preaching green \npromises and envisioning net-zero dreams. 21\nWe could not be further away from the natural, \nbalanced and circular origin of the world.\nTHE\nCIRCULAR\nECONOMY\nCircularity gives us the tools to transform our linear economy into one \nwhere waste and pollution are eliminated, products and materials are \nreused and nature is regenerated. If we integrate circular strategies into \nour economies based on the four flows below, we will ultimately require \nfewer materials and emissions to live. \nNARROW:  USE LESS\nBy minimising the overall material inputs into an economy, the \nemissions present in resources and end-products lowers: especially \nif priorityis given to the flows with the highest embodied emissions.\nIn practice: Sharing and rental models,material lightweighting, \nmultifunctional productsor buildings, energy efficiency, digitisation.\nSLOW : USE LONGER\nIn extending the functional lifetime of resources, the emissions \nattached to material flows are spread out and reduced over time.\nIn practice: Durable material use, modular design, design  \nfor disassembly, repair, remanufacturing, refurbishing,  \nrenovation,remodelling.\nREGENERATE : MAKE CLEAN\nIn using regenerative resources, the emissions in fossil fuels  \nand unsustainable biomass are cut from the economy.  \nIn practice: Regenerative material use, renewable energy,  \nregenerative agriculture.\nCYCLE:  USE AGAIN\nDepending on the energy used and emissions released during  \ncycling, this strategy has the potential to eliminate embodied \nemissions from inputs. In practice: Design for recyclability  \n(both technical and biological), design for disassembly, recycling, \nwaste-to-energy.\nPhoto by Skyler Ewing\n17\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n16\n\n\nMOBILITY\nA considerable resource and emissions \nfootprint is taken up by our need for \nmobility. In particular, two resource types \nare used: the materials to build transport \ntechnologies and vehicles like cars, trains \nand aeroplanes; plus, predominantly, the \nfossil fuels burned to power them.\nNUTRITION\nAlso with a large footprint is the need \nfor nutrition, which includes agricultural \nproducts such as crops and livestock. \nFood products have short lifecycles in \nour economy, being consumed quickly \nafter production.\nCONSUMABLES\nConsumables are a diverse and complex \ngroup of products —such as refrigerators, \nclothing, cleaning agents and paints —\nthat generally have short to medium \nlifetimes. Textiles, including clothing, also \nconsume different kinds of resources \nsuch as cotton, synthetic materials like \npolyester, dye pigments, and chemicals.\nHEALTHCARE\nWith an expanding, ageing and, on average, \nmore prosperous population, healthcare \nservices are increasing globally. Buildings \naside, typical resource groups include use  \nof capital equipment such as x-ray \nmachines, pharmaceuticals, hospital \noutfittings (beds), disposables and \nhomecare equipment.\nCOMMUNICATION\nCommunication is becoming an ever-\nmore important aspect of today’s \nsociety, provided by a mix of equipment \nand technology ranging from personal \nmobile devices to data centres. Increased \nconnectivity is also an enabler of the \ncircular economy, where digitisation can \nmake physical products obsolete, or \nenable far better use of existing assets, \nincluding consumables, building stock or \ninfrastructure.\nSERVICES\nThe delivery of services to society ranges \nfrom education and public services to \ncommercial services like banking and \ninsurance. The material and emissions \nfootprint is modest in total and typically \ninvolves the use of professional  \nequipment, office furniture, computers  \nand other infrastructure.\nSEVEN SOCIETAL NEEDS & WANTS\nHOUSING\nThe need that represents the largest \nresource and emissions footprint is \nfor construction and maintenance of \nresidential houses, especially in lower-\nincome nations.\nPhoto by Jezael Melgoza\n19\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n18\n\n\nOur 8.6% circular world is  \nconsuming 100 billion tonnes \nof resources a year\nPRACTICES\nLINEAR\nPREVAIL\n2\nFrom the bicycles we ride, to the books we read and \nthe buildings we inhabit, nearly all facets of daily \nlife are shaped by materials. And as we do more—\nbe it travelling, buying goods and even eating—we \nuse more resources. Of the 100 billion tonnes of \nresources that the world uses every year, only 8.6% \nis cycled back into our economy: over 90% of what \nwe take from the earth to fulfil our needs and wants \ngoes to waste—our throwaway society in practice. \nIn our first report in 2018, we introduced these \nfigures in a material x-ray of our global economy, \nwhich visualised the global material footprint that \nlies behind meeting our key needs and wants, be \nthey Nutrition or Housing. The x-ray depicts these \n‘hidden currents of our lives—the massive flows \nof raw materials and products deployed, to such \na wonderful and damaging effect, by 7.7 billion \nhumans. Our shared metabolism, you might say,’  \nto quote National Geographic’s coverage of our \nCircularity Gap Report 2020 . This chapter dives into \nthe material x-ray and what this tells us about why \nglobal circularity has reduced from 9.1% to 8.6% in \nonly two years.\nFROM PARIS TO GLASGOW...\nmore than half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials were \nconsumed; and the Circularity Gap got worse, not better. \nOn top of this, resource extraction is forecast to almost \ndouble between now and 2050. \nIn only six years, the world economy consumed an \nadditional half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials, \nnamely minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass.  \nThese enormous volumes of materials—by and large \nwasted after use—are climbing year on year. Ultimately, \nwaste is connected to most environmental problems, \nfrom biodiversity loss, global warming and air pollution \nto plastic soup.\nThe covid-19 pandemic led to rapid behavioural  \nchanges and government decisions that occurred  \nalmost overnight. However, we failed to see a \ntransformation of consumption patterns: material \nextraction and global emissions only showed a very \nminor and temporary decline. Already at the end of \n2021, we witnessed soaring energy prices because \ndemand for energy and materials increased so sharply, \nwhile GHG emissions also soared. 22\nMore structurally, in only 50 years, global material use \nhas nearly quadrupled—outpacing population growth. 23 \nIn 1972, as the Club of Rome’s Limits to Growth was \npublished, the world consumed 28.6 billion tonnes. \nAt the turn of the Millenium, this had gone up to \n54.9 billion tonnes and as of 2019, it surpassed 100 \nbillion tonnes. Accompanying the rapid acceleration \nof consumption is rising waste levels: ultimately, over \n90% of all extracted and used materials end up as \nwaste. On the flip side, only 8.6% makes it back into our \neconomy.\nThis rate of extraction continues to threaten the \nplanet’s future—and our lives on it. Yet forecasts paint \na grim future: according to the International Resource \nPanel, material use may increase to between 170 \nand 184 billion tonnes in 2050 if business as usual \nprevails. 24 \nThe circular economy provides a framework for \ndecoupling growth from material extraction: it can \ncreate the conditions for sustainable development, \nmeeting the needs of the growing population without \nrelying on the use of primary resources.\n21\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n\nMASS: THE GLOBAL \nMATERIAL FOOTPRINT \nSATISFYING SOCIETAL \nNEEDS\nOur material x-ray depicts how resource groups \n(minerals, metal ores, fossil fuels and biomass) are \ndeployed to satisfy the societal needs shown on page \n19—as well as what happens to them after we chuck \nthem in the bin (end-of-use). Looking at Figure Two,  \nwe see both the volume of extracted resources globally \nper year (92.0 billion tonnes) and all of the resources  \nthat were cycled (8.65 billion tonnes). This brings  \nthe total of material inputted into the economy to  \n100.6 billion tonnes.\nOf the total material inputs, a hefty chunk (48 billion \ntonnes) went into long-term stock: largely buildings, \ninfrastructure and heavy machinery. From that same \nstock, 17 billion tonnes of materials were removed \nor demolished, leaving a net addition of 31 billion \ntonnes in the year. The materials used for this stock are \nlocked-in and won’t become available for cycling back \ninto the economy until the stock reaches its end-of-use \nphase. In terms of the short-lived products that were \nconsumed by the global economy—think of everyday \nitems like clothing or packaging—a large share remains \nunaccounted for and is assumed to be dispersed into \nthe environment as unrecoverable waste.\nIn total, 32.6 billion tonnes of materials are collected as \nwaste. The majority of this stream, 23.9 billion tonnes, \nis lost; it is landfilled, incinerated, wasted at mining \noperations or otherwise dealt with informally and ‘off \nthe books’. Of the materials classified as waste, only \n8.65 billion tonnes, or 8.6% of the total material use of \nsociety, is actually cycled.\nFigure Two: Visualising how our global resource footprint \nmeets our key societal needs—and that the global economy  \nis only 8.6% circular\n23\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n22\n\n\nFROM 9.1% TO 8.6% CIRCULAR:\nWHAT’S GOING ON?\nOnly two years after the 9.1% measurement, our \nanalysis found that the circularity of the world had \nfallen to 8.6% (as shown in detail in Figure Two). And \nwe now know that material use is not only increasing, \nbut accelerating beyond even population growth.  \nSince 1970, the American population has grown by \n60%, disproportionately accompanied by an increase in \nconsumer spending of 400%: a trend common among \nnations with an expanding middle class. 25 \nThe negative shift overall can be explained by two \nrelated, underlying trends:\nOur growth rate of resource extraction \noutpaces improvements in efficiency and \nin end-of-use recovery by a factor of two \nto three—and as a result, the quantities of \nsecondary materials available for use are \nfalling short.\nOur capacity for recovery and recycling fails to \nmatch current rates of consumption. While in \nmany parts of the world recovery is on the rise—\nsteered by comprehensive government policy and \ntechnical innovation and investment—our capacity \nfor reuse can’t match our need for resources. By \nway of illustration: solid waste recovery in Europe \nincreased, on average, by 11% between 2011 and \n2016, with countries such as Sweden, Austria and \nLuxembourg leading the way and boasting recovery \nrates above 80%—but extraction continues. 26 And \nin the Netherlands, a circular frontrunner, the use of \nnatural resources is barely declining despite efficiency \nincreasing—be it designing a plastic bottle to have a \nlighter cap, or reducing the amount of pulp required to \nmake a ream of office paper. 27 \nUltimately, our limited capacity to cycle  materials at \nan equal level around the world means that quantities \nof secondary materials available for reuse fall short: \nwe still need huge amounts of virgin materials to \nsatisfy our lifestyles. Overall material consumption \nmust also be reduced to narrow  flows: if the common \ndenominator (consumption of primary materials) \nkeeps growing, our advances in material efficiency and \ncycling can never keep up. The processes still entail \nresource extraction.\nTo serve the needs of a growing population, \nwe keep extracting materials to build \nhousing, infrastructure and heavy \nmachinery—we should make use of what  \nis already there.  \nCountries are continually investing in new buildings \nand infrastructure to meet a variety of societal needs. \nCurrent estimates suggest that 255 billion square \nmetres of buildings exist across the globe—a figure \nexpected to almost double within the next four \ndecades. This is equal to erecting cities the size of Paris \nevery week. 28 This stock build-up is not inherently \nbad; many nations need to invest to ensure access to \nbasic services, particularly in Build and Grow countries \n(see Chapter Four). But as our global population \nis projected to swell to 9.9 billion over the next 30 \nyears and land-use concerns come to the fore, we’re \nincreasingly building up . This is concerning as tall \nbuildings are inherently unsustainable: skyscrapers \nrequire extra resources for foundational and structural \nsupport: namely, cement. 29 Cement use is extremely \nemissions-intensive but demand continues to rise. 30 \nAlso, increasing renewable energy generation, \ndistribution and storage capacity to regenerate  \nenergy flows will entail building up infrastructure, \nsuch as wind turbines or electrical grids. Fortunately, \nthis is happening at scale: G20 members have set new \nrecords in building capacity for solar and wind power—\nnearly doubling the amount of wind power produced in \n2020 compared to 2019. 31 \nRegardless, when materials, mostly minerals and \nores, are invested into stock in the form of buildings, \ninfrastructure and heavy machinery, they become \nembedded and unavailable as secondary materials \nfor as long as they remain stored and in use. It is, \ntherefore, paramount that virgin resources are not \nextracted to continue building up this stock, but  \nrather that we design, produce, maintain and reuse \nbuildings, roads and machinery in a circular manner  \nto cycle flows. \nChapter Three outlines circular economy strategies \nthat can reduce our overall resource extraction and \nconsumption by 28%—allowing us to make the most of \nimprovements in efficiency, product design, recycling \nand reuse, so as to narrow, slow, regenerate and \ncycle flows as a result. With this reduction in global \nemissions by 22.8 billion tonnes, we can close the \nEmissions Gap and keep warming temperatures to \n1.5-degrees. \nFROM A MASS FOCUS TO VALUE AND \nCARBON: THE MASS, VALUE, CARBON \n(MVC) NEXUS\nThe circular economy is a big picture and holistic idea. \nUltimately, it is a means to an end—the end being a \nsocially just and ecologically safe space. But to  \nreach this goal, we have to look at more than only \nresource flows. In our 2019 report, we introduced \nthe Mass-Value-Carbon (MVC) nexus, a concept that \nlooks at how much greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \n(Carbon) and value-created (Value) are distributed \nthrough meeting our key societal needs and wants with \nmaterials (Mass). The MVC became the starting point \nfor a more holistic view of our economy.\nOur 2021 Report built on this MVC concept and \nprofoundly deepened our exploration; scrutinising \nhow global GHG emissions arise from the extraction, \nprocessing and use of resources, and paving the way \nfor a set of solutions that cut both resource extraction \nand use and GHG emissions. Read more in the  \nnext Chapter.\n2\n1\n25\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n24\n\n\nTHE\nLINK\nCIRCU-\nLARITY-\nCLIMATE\n3\nThree consecutive Circularity Gap Reports  were \ndevoted to answering the question of how circular \nthe global economy is and identifying the key \nlevers to move us towards circularity—with a focus \non mass. Initially, our inspiration came from the \nUN’s Emissions Gap reports—and for our 2021 \nanalysis, the Emissions Gap returned to the fore, as \nwe undertook the task of quantifying how closing \nthe Circularity Gap could also help to close the \nEmissions Gap. We found that our climbing rates \nof resource use are responsible for catapulting \nbillions of tonnes of human-made (greenhouse \ngases) GHGs into our atmosphere—70% of \nemissions, to be precise. In 2019 alone, we emitted \n59.1 billion tonnes of GHGs to satisfy global \nneeds and wants. 32 Our Circularity Gap Report \n2021 quantitatively mapped how GHG emissions \nand resources move through our economy, from \nextraction to end-of-use. In uncovering the \nsynergistic relationship between resource use and \nGHG emissions, we now present a roadmap of 21 \ncircular solutions for the world that can transform \nour use of materials and cut emissions.\nFor a decade, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) has highlighted the Emissions Gap \nevery year. The Emissions Gap assesses the level\nof GHGs that will be emitted if we continue to \nplunder along a business as usual path that includes \ncurrent Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), \ncompared to the level we must limit emissions to keep \nglobal temperature rise below 2-degrees, and ideally \n1.5-degrees. The Emissions Gap that is referred to \nin this report is defined in reference to a 1.5-degree \ntrajectory to be achieved by 2032, thereby meeting  \nthe goal of staying well below 2-degrees of warming, \nand ideally 1.5-degrees, as specified by the  \nParis Agreement.\nTO CLOSE BOTH THE EMISSIONS AND \nCIRCULARITY GAPS, WE NEED TO LOOK \nBEYOND CLEAN ENERGY\nNet-zero and decarbonisation promises have never \nbeen more prevalent—yet despite the headline-\ngrabbing claims of governments, the use of coal \nis predicted to rise by 5% in 2021 alone in G20 \ncountries. 33 Not only is climate action disappointing, \nbut so are pledges for action. The vast majority of \nNDCs crafted during the Paris Agreement in 2015 and \nupdated for COP26—which have the aim of keeping \nwarming global temperature below 2-degrees and \nideally 1.5-degrees—fell overwhelmingly short of the \ngoal. They hardly mention resource extraction, use \nor consumption rates and only one-third allude to \nthe circular economy. Instead, the focus was largely \non the clean energy transition: ditching fossil fuels \nin favour of energy sources such as solar or wind. \nThis resulted in efforts centred on energy sources in \nindustries with high GHG emissions: namely electricity, \nheat, construction, transportation and manufacturing. \nAlthough the energy transition is hugely important, \nit’s not the only way to cut emissions, and as the initial \nNDCs showed, it’s not impactful enough alone. \nBased on the material x-ray, in Figure Two, from our \nformative reports, our 2021 Report mapped this \nx-ray agaisnt how GHGs flow through our economy. \nThis uncovered how the vast majority of GHG \nemissions (70%) are ultimately generated through \nmaterial handling and use—be it the clothes we \nwear, the phones we own or the meals we eat. This \ndemonstrated how important it is to consider resource \nuse—and consumption levels—in our efforts to cut \nglobal GHG emissions. As circular economy strategies \nultimately prioritise material value-retention and \ncut excessive consumption, they can be extremely \neffective in cutting GHG emissions. This is how  \nclosing the Circularity Gap, can help to close the \nEmissions Gap.\nEMISSIONS AND MATERIAL-INTENSIVE \nNEEDS: MOBILITY, HOUSING AND \nNUTRITION \nIn analysing and illustrating how 59.1 billion tonnes of \nemissions flow along and across global value chains in \nan emissions x-ray, we gained a deeper understanding \nof the upstream drivers of global emissions and which \nsocietal needs and wants generate the most emissions. \nAfter establishing that 70% of all global emissions were \ntied to resource use and handling, we were left with \nthe question: which needs and wants should we focus \non to make the deepest reductions possible?\nEnacted globally, a  \ncircular economy can help  \nclose the Emissions Gap\nPhoto by Damir Omerovic\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n\nMOBILITY, HOUSING AND NUTRITION \nACCOUNT FOR ALMOST 70% OF GLOBAL \nEMISSIONS \n• Mobility has the largest emissions footprint at 17.1 \nbillion tonnes—largely due to fossil fuel use across \npassenger and freight transport. \n• The production of automobiles, trucks, trains \nand aeroplanes is relatively limited in emissions \ncontributions. \n• Housing, at 13.5 billion tonnes of emissions, has \nthe second largest contribution. This is due to \nthe vast extraction, transport and construction \nactivities it entails, as well as the energy used to \nlight, heat and cool our homes. \n• Third in line is the provision of food for Nutrition, \nwhich contributes 10 billion tonnes of emissions. \n• Land use, land-use change and forestry \n(LULUCF)—a GHG inventory sector referring to \nemissions from human land-use activities—is \nassociated with the production of food, but also \nfibres and clearing for the expansion of urban \ncentres, and is responsible for about 4 billion \ntonnes of emissions. \n• The remaining 30% of emissions flow into \nsatisfying our need for Communications, Services, \nConsumables and Healthcare. \nFrom this information, we devised scenarios to get us \nback on track to achieving the Paris Agreements goal: \na well below 2-degree world, and ideally 1.5-degrees. \nIn doing this analysis, we started where the NDCs left \noff: we did not include the clean energy transition in \nour solutions. This was to make the most valuable \ncontribution to the debate, next to the transition \nalready underway. Therefore, the Emissions Gap \nwe sought to close was uncovered by the NDCs and \ncurrent policies.\n29\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n28\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nVORTEX\nFigure Three: Shows the impact of our interventions  \non the Circularity and Emissions Gaps\n-0.7\nSustainable\nfoodproduction\nReducetravel\nImprove\nvehicle\nutilisation\nResource\neﬃcient\nconstruction\n‘Natural’housingsolutions\nCleancooking\nstoves\nReduction\nexcess\nconsumption\n1.5°C\n2.4°C\nResource \neﬃcient\nhousing\n-0\n.9\nCircular\nvehicles\nVehicles\ndurability\nVehicles\ndesign\nimprovements\nEﬃcient\ndesign\n& use\nof ICTs\nCircular\nhealthcaresystem\nDurable\nconsumerproducts\nEﬃcient design\n& use of\nconsumerproducts\nCircularconsumables\nChemi-cals free\n-3.4\n-3.4\n-6.5\n-1.3\n-1.5\n-1.8\n-2.4-1\n-1.3\n-1.2\n-1\n-0.3-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.2\n-0.5\n-0.4\nCircular \nconstruction materials\n-1.1\n-3.5\n-3.4\nIncreasehousing\ndurability\nReduceﬂoor\nspace\n-2.1\n-3.2\n-5.3\n-8.4\n-4\n-3.1\n-0 .5\n-2.5\n-1.2\n-2.2\n-3.3\n-1.6\n-2\n-0 .8\n-0 .3\n-0.3\n-0\n.3\n-2.1\n-2\nHealthy \ndiet\n \ntotal reduction in global \ntemperature increase by \n2050\nLATEST ONE\n11/1/2021\ntotal reduction in global \ntemperature increase by \n2050\n \nLEGEND\nSome interventions overlap, which means that \nthe total combined effect is significantly less than \nwhen all individual interventions are simply added \ntogether. This is because some interventions, when \ncombined, will partially cancel each other out. For \nexample, in ‘Reduce floor space’, we also reduce \nthe volumes of construction and demolition waste \n(C&DW) that become available for recycling and \nrepurposing. Another example is the absolute impact \nof lightweighting the global car fleet in ‘Vehicle \ndesign improvements’, which is directly moderated \nby the size of the said fleet, which in turn is reduced \nby, for instance, car sharing. This dynamic between \ninterventions and the extent of their overlaps is \nvisually depicted by the boxes. \nFor each solution, the figure shows its potential to \nreduce GHG emissions as the width of the intervention \n‘box’, and the material footprint reduction by the \nheight of the box. The image shows the contribution \nof each intervention separately, as well as for all \ninterventions combined. \n21 CIRCULAR SOLUTIONS FOR A  \n1.5-DEGREE PATHWAY\nFigure Three on the next page shows how a roadmap \nof 21 interventions across six scenarios can mitigate \nclimate impact by curbing GHG emissions. We did \nnot model interventions specially for the societal \nneed of Services as the materials used and emissions \nreleased in performing such Services are included in \nother categories. For example, repair interventions—\nclassified as a service—are addressed under most of\nthe other needs and wants. Encompassing actions \nfor businesses, cities and nations, the 21 solutions \nprovide input for a more profound and fundamental \ntransformation of the economy than the current \npathways that make up the vast majority of NDCs. \nThis set of 21 circular strategies can keep the planet on \na 1.5-degree trajectory by cutting emissions by  \n22.8 billion tonnes beyond what is achieved by the \nupdated climate commitments: a 39% reduction from \n2019 levels.\nTogether, the combined interventions can almost \ndouble the current global Circularity Metric of 8.6%, \nbringing it to 17%.

Transitioning to a fully circular economy \nwithin a generation will require urgent and large-\nscale actions from all parts of society. National and \nlocal governments will need to provide direction \nand enabling conditions, consumers will need \nto make choices that encourage circularity and \nbusinesses will need to redesign their processes \nand products from the ground up.\nNations and their governments essentially establish \nthe ‘rules of the game’ at the national level through \npolicy or ambitious target setting. They can create the \nconditions that enable and promote or indeed block \nor hinder—circular transformations. These conditions \nwill directly influence the activities of businesses \nand cities in the nation. For instance, taxation is a \npowerful instrument to create the right incentives that \nsteer behaviour of market players, such as promoting \nplant-based diets or increasing the share of secondary \nmaterials in construction activities. Regulations such \nas bans (of polluting chemicals or plastic bags, for \nexample) and standards like mandatory minimums (of \nrecycled content in packaging, for example) are also \ncentral. While national governments have an important \nrole to play in creating general frameworks, regional \nand local governments (cities)  can enhance and adapt \nthem to their specific context. Learn more about how \nnations can drive the transition on our website .\nCities are responsible for 60% of resource \nconsumption, 70% of global waste and 70% of global \nGHG emissions. They are also hubs of infrastructure, \ninnovation, manufacturing and business, and are \nthus crucial locations in which circular economy \nactions must take place. Even in cases where national \ngovernments may not provide suitable enabling \nconditions for circularity, there are a number of ways \nin which city governments can integrate and support \nit through their policies and day-to-day decisions \nand operations (public procurement, for example). \nLocal governments often have jurisdiction over waste \ncollection, public transport networks, urban planning \nand local economic development, and are in many \ncases able to implement impactful changes more \nrapidly than national governments can. The Mayor of \nLondon, for example, has set an ambitious target for \nLondon to reach net-zero emissions by 2030, 20 years \nearlier than the UK government’s goal. 34 They are also \nbetter positioned to engage with local businesses, \nnonprofits and community organisations to align their \nefforts toward circularity goals. Learn more about how \ncities can drive the transition on our website .\nBusinesses  practically implement and execute actions \nbased on policy set by local and national governments. \nThey can also make fast and independent decisions for \ntheir own value chains. This makes them innovation \ndrivers, and businesses around the world have \nbeen moving to more circular approaches. There \nis real opportunity for businesses to reduce costs, \nbuild resilience in their supply chains, comply with \nemerging policies and meet investor and customer \nrequirements, through moving to a more circular \napproach. 35 Learn more about how businesses can \ndrive the transition on our website .\nDIFFERENT COUNTRIES, DIFFERENT \nRESPONSIBILITIES \nTo influence our climate future for generations to \ncome and see results,our global roadmap must be \ntailored to national pathways. Translating these \nglobal interventions to the national level must take \ninto account carbon inequality. Nearly half (48%) of \ncumulative CO 2 emissions over the last quarter century \ncan be attributed to the richest 10% of the globe, \nwhilst the poorest 50% were responsible for only \n7%.36 Over the past few decades, the global carbon \nbudget has largely been spent by the consumption of \nthe rich and has failed to lift other areas of the world \nout of poverty. And in a cruel irony, this emissions \ninequality also has another side: lower-income nations \nwho contribute the fewest emissions are also most \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate breakdown. Such \nnations are still fighting to receive adequate climate \nfinancing from richer nations, following the failure of \nCOP26 on this front.\nOur 2021 report presented the emissions and \nmaterial footprint of three different country profiles, \nBuild, Grow and Shift, (see pages 40-42) in absolute \nterms from a consumption perspective. It found \nthat Build countries are home to the greatest share \nof the globe’s population but are only responsible \nfor 17% of emissions—yet most at risk for climate \ninduced disasters. Grow countries, home to rapidly \nindustrialising populations, produce 47% of global \nemissions and 51% of global resource extraction. \nMeanwhile Shift counties, which house a minority of \nthe global population, produce the largest share of \nemissions and account for one-third (31%) of all global \nresource extraction.\nPhoto by Eberhard Grossgasteiger\n35\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n34\n\n\nFOR\nCIRCULAR\nECO-\nNOMY\nSOCIETY\n4\nOur response to the climate emergency must \nreduce global and local inequalities and protect \nagainst overshooting the means of the planet.  \nOur 2020 Report found that all countries are failing \nwhen it comes to reaching an ecologically safe and \nsocially just space. Some countries are close, others \nare far away; each starts from a different point on \nthe map, but all have a distance to go. We believe \nthe circular economy can help close the distance \ncountries have from the safe and just space—but \ngetting there will look very different for different \nstakeholders and nations. Each country must tailor \nthe roadmap of 21 circular solutions to suit their \ncontext and populations. If we don’t tailor solutions \nfor different countries and incorporate social and \nethical considerations in the circular economy \ntransition, we risk repeating the same mistakes \nof the linear economy—which has often relied on \nexploiting people and the planet.\nIn all Circularity Gap Reports , ethical considerations \nand trade-offs that could potentially arise in the \ncircular transition have been a careful consideration. \nThe circular economy must not perpetuate the same \nmistakes as the linear economy. We, therefore, \npinpoint the seven core societal needs and wants \nthat guide our research: Housing, Nutrition, Mobility, \nCommunications, Services, Consumables and \nHealthcare (see page 19). The global roadmap must be \nresource-efficient, but also people-centric; the impact \nof one circular strategy can have vastly different \nrepercussions on communities in different localities \nand this must be taken into account. \nConsider this: although a healthy diet requires 2,000 \ncalories per day for a typical female, the intake in \nsome countries may be far higher, while malnutrition \npersists in others. The more calorie-intensive diets \ncould consist of out-of-season, imported foods that \nhave travelled across the globe, or high levels of animal \nprotein. Calling to reduce consumption here may be \nappropriate and even ethical, but less so in cases \nwhere access to basic nutritious food is limited. The \ncircular economy is also about achieving a structural \nand cultural shift where we can satisfy everyone’s \nuniversal needs within the boundaries of the planet—\nbut there are important differences between countries \nand regions to take into consideration.\nCircular solutions can help\nmove countries toward a\nsafe and just space\nPhoto by Manish Tulaskar \nNO COUNTRY IS WITHIN A SAFE  \nAND JUST SPACE\nCountries all exist on a spectrum, which we measured \nin our 2020 Report along two dimensions:  \nthe Human Development Index (HDI) and Ecological \nFootprint (which measures humanity’s demand \non ecosystems). 37 In an ideal world, all countries \nwould have strong HDI scores and a low Ecological \nFootprint—providing for the needs of their citizens \nwithin the means of the planet. Currently, no country \nhas created this ecologically safe and socially just \nspace for humanity. Figure Five on the next page \ndemonstrates how no one country has reached the \n‘safe and just’ space. We all have work to do and the \ncircular economy can play a pivotal role.\nCountries that score high on HDI have stable \ngovernments, widespread education and healthcare, \nhigh life expectancies, and growing, powerful \neconomies. Low scores indicate unstable governments, \nwidespread poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and \npoor education. They often also have low incomes and \nlow life expectancies, coupled with high birth rates. \nSome countries occupy spaces in between. \nImplementing the circular economy must recognise \nthat different approaches are appropriate in different \ncontexts to ensure local needs are met, while limiting \nthe environmental impacts of associated resource use.\nA\n37\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n\nDistance to Safe and Just space\nEach orbit clusters countries that share a \nsimilar distance to the safe and just space.\nCloser to center = preferable\nSocial Performance\nMeasured by the United Nations’ \nHuman Development Index (HDI)\nHigher = preferable\n0.8 to 1\n0.65 to 0.79\n0 to 0.649Ecological Footprint\nMeasured in average Global \nHectares (GHa) per person in \nrelation to the earth's biocapacity\nSmaller = preferable\nwithin 1 planet\n1 to 2 planets \nmore than\n     2 planets\nEco lo g ic a l l y  s a f e  a n d  s o c i a l l y  j u s t  s p a ce\nf o r  h u m a n i t y\nM APPING COUNTRIES’\nDISTANCE FROM THE \nSAFE & JUST SPACE\nThe Galaxy shows how far 176 countries are from operating in an ecologically \nsafe and socially just space for humanity: meeting basic human needs while \nstaying within the Earth’s biophysical boundaries.

While their citizens live within planetary \nboundaries, these countries are characterised by low  \nHDI rankings. Although it has been on a steady decline \nfor the last two decades, poverty is widespread \nand covid-19 sparked a surge in extreme poverty in \nBuild countries. 38 These countries are also especially \nvulnerable to extreme weather events that will \nthreaten lives and damage livelihoods and sectors \nranging from agriculture to the built environment. \nMeasures that build up resilience are particularly called \nfor—especially as populations grow and governments \nstrive for increased industrialisation. \nWhile the position of Build countries is precarious,  \nit’s also full of opportunity: as they develop  \ninfrastructure and work to meet the needs of their \ncitizens, there is a chance to bypass the degrading \nprocesses employed by Grow and Shift countries,  \ninstead applying circular models. \nREVISITING TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE, \nBRIDGING THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP\nWidespread desertification and forest loss have \nencouraged many Sub-Saharan Africa populations \nto switch from traditional roofing techniques—using \nmud and timber—to corrugated iron sheets and sawn \ntimber beams—which have inadequate thermal and \nacoustic insulation and they can further accelerate \ndeforestation. The association for Voute Nubienne \n(Nubian Vault) has established a programme in \nBurkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou (and has recently \nexpanded to Mali, Senegal and Togo) that promotes an \nancient architectural technique to construct timberless \nvaulted roofs, which protect during the rainy season, \nstay cool during hot days and radiate heat back at \nnight. The programme teaches villagers to make \nthis roofing themselves using readily available local \nmaterials, thereby meeting local housing needs with a \nlow-carbon option that also helps to prevent further \ndeforestation. 39\nIn some Build countries, up to 45% of harvested fresh \nfruits and vegetables can go to waste—mainly due \nto lack of cold storage. 40 Reducing food waste—and \nproviding affordable solutions for farmers in  \nNigeria—is ColdHubs: a post-harvest, solar-powered, \ncooling-as-service solution in Nigeria. By offering an \noption for storing and preserving perishable foods that \nadequately meets the financial needs of smallholder \nfarmers, ColdHubs is a solution to the issue of \npost-harvest losses of fruits, vegetables and other \nperishable food. The company offers farmers a flexible \npay-as-you-store subscription model at rates that \nthey can afford, helping to tackle the barrier of access \nto financing for cold chain solutions and bridging the \ntechnological gap for smallholder farmers.\nAs India’s population grows and urbanisation \nincreases, energy consumption in buildings is \nexpected to grow in tandem. The Indian government \nhas implemented policy schemes to mainstream \nsustainable practices: appliance standards, mandatory \nlabelling and certification, energy efficiency \nrequirements and utility demand-side management \nprogrammes. Buildings have minimum requirements \nfor heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, \nand the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has \nimplemented several programmes on using renewable \nenergy in buildings. 41\nFinally, many Build countries lack access to the \ntechnologies and investments required to transition \nfrom artisanal to industrial recycling operations. To \naddress this issue, the African Development Bank \nis financing the implementation of a plastic waste \ncollection and recycling infrastructure in Ivory \nCoast. Using innovative recycling technologies, this \noperation not only provides local industries with raw \nmaterials, but also supports the social and economic \nreintegration of 2,000 ex-combatants. 42\nGROW\nGrow countries—like China and Brazil—are rapidly \nindustrialising: while they don’t yet match the wealth \nof Shift countries, or have HDI rankings as high, their \neconomies are growing exponentially. They’ve lifted \nsignificant proportions of their populations out of \npoverty in recent years—fostering a growing middle \nclass—yet social mobility remains relatively low. While \nit could take a family two generations to transition \nfrom low- to middle-income in a socially mobile \ncountry, for example, in Brazil it may take nine: 43 so \nwhile extreme poverty is less prevalent, much of these \ncountries’ wealth remains locked in the middle class. \nGrow countries’ quick-paced growth is matched by a \nneed for resources: they account for more than half of \nthe world’s resource extraction and a little under half \nof global emissions. \nLABOUR PROTECTION FOR WASTE \nPICKERS, SMARTER WASTE MANAGEMENT\nWork outside of the formal economy (for example, \nwaste picking) is common in some Grow countries—\nbut still, many waste pickers lack social status and \nlabour protection. In Mexico, Danone has built a \nsorting centre outside the landfill where waste pickers \ncan sort waste more efficiently and safely. As a result, \nover 400 families have seen their income rise by 30% \nand their health care covered. 44\nMeanwhile, Brazil touts a social business, Rede Asta, \nthat helps divert waste from Brazil’s vast landfills—\neach day about 175,000 tonnes of solid waste is \ncollected around the country, only an estimated \n2.7% of which is recycled. 45 The women-led initiative \ncollects the waste and unused equipment of hundreds \nof companies and offers them bespoke designs \nusing the discarded materials—often being used for \nthe company’s marketing purposes, for example. \nThis scalable approach is made possible through a \nnationwide network of artisans, with Rede Asta acting \nas a matchmaker to facilitate new sales opportunities. \nOver in São Paulo, outdoor advertising has been \nbanned—making space for street art, community \nnotice boards and trees instead. This move has \nencouraged a needed shift toward more sustainable \nlifestyles by reducing consumption, a reduction in \nvisual pollution and improving aesthetics and air \nquality for communities. 46\nIn Bogatá, Colombia, the circular economy is driving \nsmarter wastewater management in a bid to return \nthe Bogatá river to its former glory. Since the 1950s, \nthe river has faced wastewater discharges from \ndomestic and industrial sources, as well as from \nurban runoff and the dumping of solid waste, leading \nto water so polluted it could no longer supply the \ncity. Now, the city is implementing circular principles \nto spotlight flood control, wastewater management \nand water quality restoration, and the wastewater \ntreatment plant was redesigned with energy efficiency \nand resource recovery at its heart. Now, the plant \ngenerates a significant part of the energy needed for \nits own disinfection treatment processes, for example. \nIn the future, the plant will also produce biosolids and \nreusable wastewater for local agriculture. 47 \nIn another initiative, the city is capturing dangerous \nbiogases emitting from overflowing landfills—and \nproviding vocational training to youth in the process. \nThe Doña Juana Landfill is the first in Colombia to \ncapture landfill biogas and turn it into electricity. In \ncapturing biogas, neighbouring communities are no \nlonger exposed to poisonous gases such as ammonia \nand hydrogen sulfide, protecting especially poor \npopulations living near the landfill. 48\n41\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n40\n\n\nSHIFT\nShift countries—like European countries and the US—\nlargely enjoy high HDI scores, but their citizens live far \nbeyond the planet’s means. It is estimated that if every \nperson were to live and consume like an American, we \nwould need five Earths to sustain our population. 49 \nWhile accounting for a minority of the world, these \ncountries produce 43% of emissions, and account for \nnearly one-third of all resource extraction. While Shift \ncitizens on the whole enjoy comfortable lifestyles \nmarked by often excessive levels of consumption, and \nsocial mobility tends to be high, poverty still exists. \nWhile uncommon, extreme poverty—living on less \nthan US$ 1.90 a day—still afflicts about 0.6% of people \nacross Shift countries. 50 The national poverty lines for \nsuch nations are often around 20 times greater than \nthis international value for extreme poverty. The gap \nbetween rich and poor is widening, too: in the OECD, \nwhich is almost exclusively composed of Shift nations, \nincome inequality is the highest it’s been for the last \nseveral decades. 51 This trend is only set to increase as \nthe costs of housing and other goods are outpacing \nincreases in earnings, putting a tight squeeze on the \ngrowth of the middle class. 52\nSHEDDING CAR-CENTRIC URBAN DESIGN, \nRECYCLE AND REPAIR REIGN\nShift countries have already built up most of their \ninfrastructure—and now, circular strategies centre \non undoing some of the harmful patterns these \nmodes of development have created. Barcelona has \nundertaken an innovative new means for urban living \nto tackle car-centric design: the formation of 400 by \n400 metre ‘superblocks’ that close off small inner \nstreets to through traffic. Only emergency vehicles, \ntransport for the disabled and vehicles for residential \naccess are allowed. The result? A burst of new spaces \nfor pedestrian use and community events, flourishing \nbiodiversity, more sustainable modes of transport—\nlike walking and cycling—and safer, more cohesive \ncommunities. Considered a ‘global best practice’ \nfor urban design that prioritises people over cars, \nBarcelona’s superblocks have caused green spaces’ \npresence in the city to catapult from 0.6% to 11% in \njust one year, and have transformed streets into dining \nspaces, play places and event locales. 53\nAcross the world in Rosario, Argentina, the local \ngovernment has put circular economy strategies \ninto practice to revitalise its economy, address \nfood security crises and reverse unemployment. \nIts UN-lauded Urban Agriculture Program  equipped \nresidents with the tools and knowledge needed to \nstart their own urban farms and gardens. Organic \nand sustainable methods were prioritised, and \nformerly degraded or unused areas—from strips along \nrailways and highways to low-lying land vulnerable to \nflooding—were transformed into fruitful green spaces. \nThe programme was a resounding success: the city saw \nthe formation of 800 gardening groups that provided \nfood to 40,000 residents—as well as a number of \nweekly markets throughout Rosario, boosting social \ncohesion and a sense of community. 54\nMany affluent Shift countries are dominated by \ntake-make-waste consumption models—consumers \npurchase products that often end up in landfill long \nbefore they should. The City of Paris is taking steps to \ncombat this, supporting recycling centres in launching \nreuse centres for consumer goods. The centres also \nrun workshops where Parisians can learn to repair \ntheir household goods—and plans are in the works \nfor an exchange scheme with the private sector to \ngive municipality waste, from furniture to paving \nstones, a second life. Between 2016 and 2018 the \ncentres have diverted more than 2,600 tonnes of \nwaste from landfill—equal to savings of 17%. 55 German \nnon-profit association FairWertung is also aiming to \ngive goods another life—primarily clothing. With a \nfocus on transparency and fairness, the association \nguarantees that donated clothing is properly reused or \ncycled—rather than shipped around the globe before \neventually being discarded. 56\nPhoto by Leonid Danilov\n43\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n42\n\n\nGlasgow did not fully deliver on turning policy into \npractice and talk into action: the months leading \nup to the COP27 in Egypt are therefore pivotal to \nadvance the agenda. At the end of this year, nations \nwill gather in Sharm El Sheikh to present their \nstrengthened targets on emissions cuts. Our last \nfive years of Circularity Gap Reports  have put the \nproblem in stark terms and uncovered the solution: \n21 circular strategies that will slash emissions \nand material use, limit warming and facilitate an \nincreasingly safe and just space for humanity.  \nAside from these solutions for businesses, cities and \nnations, we need urgent, large-scale and high-level \nchange in the five years to come. These changes \nspan three core pillars: digital technology, metrics \nand measurement and social considerations, and \nalso represent Circle Economy’s key contributions  \nto accelerating the circular transition (see on the \nnext page). \nIt’s not easy to put a number on global circularity, and in \ndoing so we must bypass some of the intricacies of the \nglobal economy. But the benefits of having one number \nto guide action and to set a benchmark are manifold. \nWe know that the world’s circularity is in reverse and \nstands at only 8.6%. Our 8.6% economy is wasteful, \npolluting and carbon-intensive. In only six years, half a \ntrillion tonnes of virgin materials were taken from the \nearth to fulfil societal needs and wants: 70% more than \nwhat the earth can safely replenish. Think of the coal \nextracted from the earth’s crust: it’s first processed \nto become petroleum, which feeds into the synthetic \nfibres that weave the fast-fashion clothes we wear and \nquickly dispose of, or the harvested timber that is felled \nin the forest and processed in a sawmill to become the \nfurniture we sit on and then throw away. \nThis Report has presented the key findings of the past \nfive years to demonstrate how the circular economy \nand its rich set of solutions can thoroughly contribute to \nmitigating climate impact and moving the world toward \nan ecologically safe and socially just space.  \nWith 2021’s COP26 yielding mixed outcomes, our \nmessage remains: rallying efforts around renewable \nenergy solutions fails to address the chunk of emissions \n(70%) stemming from resource use and handling.  \nWe need the clean energy transition to happen,  \n5. THE WAY FORWARD\nbut it cannot keep us on the well below 2-degrees \ntrajectory alone. Nor does it tackle our rising \nconsumption levels and concerning resource scarcity. \nIf the world moved away from a linear economy and \ntoward a circular one, our analysis shows that global \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would drop by 39% \nand virgin resource use by 28%, and we would reach \nthe goals of the Paris Agreement.Glasgow did not \ndeliver as many had hoped, so now our attention must \nturn toward COP27 at the end of this year. \nAside from integrating circularity into the actions of \nbusinesses, cities and nations, high-level change must \nbe enacted to create the enabling conditions for a \nmore circular world. We must utilise data-driven tools \nto bring circularity to everyone, use metrics to track \nthe transition and apply a social lens to the transition \nto ensure no one is left behind. \nTHE NEXT FIVE YEARS OF THE CIRCULAR \nTRANSITION NEED AN ENABLING \nENVIRONMENT\n \n1. Data-driven digital tools to bring circularity to everyone. Digital tools \nbased on comprehensive data sets spur knowledge exchange and innovation \nat an exponential rate. Global statistical institutions and governments should \nprioritise frequent—and streamlined—data collection, on both macro and \nmicro levels. They must also collaborate with businesses to make private-\nsector data available for public sector circular decision making and impact \nanalyses. In data-scarce countries or regions,  data alliances can assist in \nfilling the gaps.\nDigital tools can enable knowledge and insights generation along the stages \nof the circular economy transition to explore what is currently happening, \nscan for relevant opportunities, and then act accordingly. Increased \ntransparency in the supply chain, and more data capture at products’ end-of-\nuse will power impactful decision making on where to apply circular strategies \nand get the most impact. Learn more about digital tools powering the circular \ntransition here.\n2. Metrics to track the transition. If we don’t measure, we cannot track \nprogress in a meaningful way, nor can we ultimately locate where the most \nimpactful avenues are. Using data to measure and track circular performance \nacross sectors, businesses, cities and nations will enable actors to set goals, \npeer review, measure and benchmark performance. It will also allow them \nto track progress against their sustainable and circular ambitions or goals \nand to formulate practical pathways aligned to local contexts. Meaningful \nmeasurement also necessitates data, linking to point one above. Learn more \nabout how to track circular performance and measure your benchmark rate \nof circularity here . \n3. A social lens to ensure the transition is safe and just. A holistic circular \neconomy that applies a social lens to all of its activities may help us support \nvarious Sustainable Development Goals, from ending hunger and improving \nhealth and well-being to affordable low-carbon energy, and the opportunity \nfor decent work and economic growth. Potential consequences from one \ncircular solution must be measured to ensure that the transition is safe and \njust for all and that potential blindspots of the circular economy are managed. \nPeople will ultimately drive the circular transition by putting the solutions \ninto practice, and for this reason, government support is needed to invest \nin training and skilling the workforce in preparation. Using data and metrics \nto track and manage how circular jobs are developing across sectors—and \nin relation to our 21 strategies—must guide and be at the foundation of the \ntransition.

Using metrics to gauge our progress in \naddressing the climate crisis is crucial. The metrics- and \ndata-driven approach that the Circularity Gap Reports have \npioneered over the past five years has been significant in \nadvancing circular metrics—but we need to go further. We \nlook forward to collaborating and sharing knowledge on this \ntopic to help us reach our 1.5-degree goal.’\nDAVID MCGINTY\nGlobal Director at the Platform \nfor Accelerating the Circular \nEconomy (PACE)\n‘The triple planetary crisis—climate, nature and  \npollution—along with the need for greater equity and \nstability—are why circular action at scale is critical now.  \nThe Circularity Gap Report continues to be an invaluable  \ntool for measuring progress towards global circularity.  \nAs PACE leaders aim to double global circularity by 2032,  \nwe are committed to continuing to enhance the data,  \ninsights and metrics required to champion and deliver  \nthe urgent actions needed.’\nJANEZ POTOČNIK\nCo-Chair at the International \nResource Panel of the \nUnited Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP)\n‘The circular economy was not on the European policy agenda \nfor a long time. From the beginning, the Circularity Gap Report  \naccompanied policy efforts to raise attention to the circular \neconomy. The reports show us a reflection of what we need \nto see in implementing the circular economy: the path from \nwords to deeds is a real challenge, which demands our focus.’\nFEIKE SIJBESMA\nClimate Advocate  \nand Honorary Chairman  \nat Royal DSM\n‘Scarcity of resources is largely a result of omissions and \nmistakes in the design and use of value chains. A switch \nfrom a linear to a circular economy enables us to re-use \nour resources almost endlessly and protect our planet and \ncivilization. The Circularity Gap Report shows the threats—as \nwell as the opportunities.’\nFRANS VAN HOUTEN\nCEO at Royal Philips and  \nCo-Chair at the Platform  \nfor Accelerating the  \nCircular Economy (PACE)\n‘The Circularity Gap Reports have played a vital role mobilising \nthe global circular economy agenda. This edition reinforces \nkey findings from five years of analysis and lays out actions \nthat companies can take to drive transformative change. \nWidespread adoption of circular strategies across all sectors \nand value chains are needed to tackle the three most \npressing challenges of the climate crisis, nature loss  \nand mounting inequality.’\nKATE RAWORTH\nAuthor of Doughnut Economics \nand Senior Teaching Associate  \nat the Environmental Change \nInstitute, University of Oxford\n‘It’s clear—we must act now! There’s no time to lose. By \napplying the circular solutions outlined in this report, we \ncan reduce the use of scarce materials and dramatically cut \nemissions—thereby fighting climate change and biodiversity \nloss. But we can only do it by joining forces. That’s why I’m \ncalling on all CEOs and business leaders, governments and \nNGOs to step up and accelerate our combined efforts, so we \ncan reach the goal of doubling circularity within ten years.  \nLet’s take bold actions and deliver impact.’\n‘Preventing and reducing resource use and reusing materials \nin a global circular economy are key strategies to protect \nthe Earth’s environment, as well as its capacity to provide \nfor current and future generations. A variety of metrics are \nneeded to understand progress alongside valuable data, \nanalysis, guidance and examples. The Circularity Gap Report  \nhas provided insights on these topics over the past five years, \nand it continues to inform progress and the action required to \naccelerate the circular transition.’\nDIMITRI DE VREEZE\nCo-CEO at Royal DSM\n‘Five years of the Circularity Gap Report has shown us that \n“business as usual” cannot be sustained. As the world’s \npopulation grows and crosses planetary boundaries, we must \nmove away from linear production and consumption systems \nand work together to build sustainable models. Bridging \nthe Circularity Gap is crucial to support the livelihoods of \ntomorrow’s population and restore the natural environment. \nLet’s start putting a price on waste and accelerate our joint \ncircular innovation power.’\nMARK WATTS\nCEO at C40\n‘A 1.5-degree world will be a circular world. Now is the time \nfor action to mitigate climate breakdown and cities have a \ncrucial role to play here. Circle Economy’s Circularity Gap \nReport 2022 shows us solid solutions and actions that cities \ncan adopt to continue leading the circular transition.’\nDIANE HOLDORF\nExecutive Vice President at \nthe World Business Council for \nSustainable Development \n‘Circularity is not becoming a reality at anything near the \nspeed or scale that these times demand—and the past five \nyears of Circularity Gap Reports have provided the essential \nand authoritative analysis to make this painfully clear. I hope \nthat future editions, over the coming five years, will be able to \nreflect a profoundly different story; using innovative metrics \nand powerful case studies to document the industrial circular \ntransformation that is so urgently needed.’\nBORGE BRENDE\nPresident at the  \nWorld Economic Forum \n‘This fifth edition of the Circularity Gap Report makes clear that \ntime is fast running out to transition from a linear economy \ntoward a circular economy. In sounding this alarm, this \nreport also thankfully offers solutions.

      "content": "The harsh reality is that between Paris and \nGlasgow, more than half a trillion tonnes of virgin \nmaterials were consumed. Also, the Circularity \nGap got worse, not better. In the six years between \nheadline-grabbing climate conferences, the global \neconomy consumed 70% more than what the Earth can \nsafely replenish.* This cannot continue—we only have \none planet. While the 2015 Paris Agreement upped \nthe global ambition with an agreement on binding \nclimate commitments, COP26 in Glasgow was a ‘fragile \nwin’ for the climate—in the words of COP26 President \nAlok Sharma. Progress was, however, made on three \nfronts: recognition of the need to put an end to fossil \nfuels; setting new rules for carbon markets, and some \nheadway on a mechanism for richer nations to pay \nfor their historical contributions to climate change. \nBut there is still much to be done, making the World \nEconomic Forum in Davos a key moment to advance \nthe agenda ahead of COP27 in Egypt at the end of \n2022. \nFive years of Circularity Gap Reports have revealed \nhow linear the world is—we only cycle 8.6% of what \nwe use, which leaves a massive Circularity Gap of \nover 90%. And in only two years, global circularity \nwilted from 9.1% in 2018 to 8.6% in 2020. As a result, \nthe wrong kinds of records are getting broken and \nset. In 2019, for instance, as well as the world having \nwarmed 1.1-degrees since the pre-industrial era, \nsociety also breached boundaries for extraction, \nconsuming 100 billion tonnes of resources. Our \nanalysis connected this resource use to key societal \nneeds and wants—how we eat, move and live—so \nthat we could quantitatively track trends in usage \nand waste. This allows us to develop people-centred, \nresource-smart and climate-safe roadmaps for change.  \nFinally, the tectonic plates of international climate \naction are visibly shifting—although slowly. It is \nalready 50 years since the landmark Club of Rome \nreport warned of the dangers of natural resource-\nuse and endless economic growth; ten years since \nthe circular economy moved from the fringes to \nthe mainstream—yet remaining far from being \nthe norm—and five years since the first Circularity \nGap Report  gave us a trackable figure for global \nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\ncircularity. Time is not on our side, but momentum \nis with us. Hot on the heels of COP26, both business \nand public interest in climate action is high, despite \nthe world still experiencing the compound effects \nof a pandemic. There is also a valuable storehouse \nof transferable knowledge out there, backed up by \nexamples of inspiring best practices. So, to achieve \nthe transformation needed, progress both needs to \naccelerate and scale. We need regenerative and ethical \nbehaviour to become the norm, over extractive and \nexploitative practices.\nThe world may feel like it’s on fire, but here’s the \nsolution: enacted globally, a circular economy can \nhelp to close the Emissions Gap. This Circularity Gap \nReport 2022  will demonstrate—based on five years of \nanalysis and learnings—how the circular economy is \na means to cut resource-use and emissions and boost \nequitable societies. With our roadmap of 21 circular \nsolutions, businesses, cities and nations can reduce \nresource extraction and use by 28%, therefore cutting \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 39% and getting the \nworld on a 1.5-degree pathway. Tailoring the roadmap \nto different localities and sectors can guide all key \nactors in the course corrections we so desperately \nneed. Whilst our roadmap is a powerful addition to \nthe clean-energy transition already underway, we \nwon’t achieve the scale of change needed unless we \nalso drop business as usual behaviours and overcome \nlinear thinking. In this iteration of the Report, we \ninvestigate these obstacles, plus showcase real-world \nexamples of circular activity.\n \nLet’s work together to close the Circularity Gap, \nfast and for everyone. It is time for collective action \nto reset our economy and begin to erase social \ninequalities. In some places, this is already happening, \nbut it must become the norm, everywhere. So, \nas promises of environmental action flow in from \ncountries around the world post-COP and attention \nturns to updating national climate pledges for COP27, \ncircularity must be heavily featured. It carries the \nsolutions countries and businesses need to meet their \nclimate goals, safeguard the Earth’s resources and \nprotect all people. It’s time for a circular economy.  \nIn only six years, the global economy consumed an \nadditional half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials, \nnamely minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass.  \nThese enormous volumes of materials—by and \nlarge wasted after use— are climbing year on year. \nUltimately, waste is connected to most environmental \nproblems, from biodiversity loss, global warming and \nair pollution to plastic soup.\nIn only 50 years, global use of materials has nearly \nquadrupled—outpacing population growth. 1 In 1972, \nas the Club of Rome’s report Limits to Growth was \npublished, the world consumed 28.6 billion tonnes.  \nBy 2000, this had gone up to 54.9 billion tonnes and  \nas of 2019, it surpassed 100 billion tonnes.  \nRising waste levels are accompanying the rapid \nacceleration of consumption: ultimately, over 90% of \nall materials extracted and used are wasted.  \n20502000 2015\n 2021\n1972\n28.6 Gt\n54.9 Gt\n89.9 Gt\n101.4 Gt\n170 Gt\n184 Gt\n93 Gt\nClub of Rome:\nLimits to Growth\nTurn of the\nmillenium\nCOP21 - Paris\nCOP26 - Glasgow\nBetween Paris\nand Glasgow,\nmore than\nhalf a trillion\ntonnes of virgin\nmaterials\nwere consumed.\nProjected\nWith business\nas usual, material\nextraction is\nprojected to surpass\nbetween 170 Gt and\n184 Gt by 2050.\nM a te rial e x tra ction  in billio n  to n nes (G t)\nOr, on the flip side, only 8.6% make it back into our \neconomy.

We are \nliving in a time of rampant pollution and waste, \nresource scarcity, biodiversity loss and warming \nglobal temperatures: all of which are linked in \nsome way to our rising levels of consumption. A \nsocial and economic system that has this impact \non its natural environment cannot be called a \nhealthy one. In the past year alone, a cascade of \nalarming environmental events swept the globe, \nfrom wildfires and storms to floods and droughts. \nWithout action, climate breakdown could displace \nhundreds of million people by 2050 3 and result in \na catastrophic loss of biodiversity. The sixth IPCC \nreport 4 definitively stated—for the first time—that \nclimate change is driven by us: human activity got \nus here. But it can also get us out—the solution is in \nour hands. It’s been five years since our Circularity \nGap Report first calculated the circular state of \nthe world. In this short time, the world has gone \nfrom 9.1% circular in 2018 to 8.6% in 2020, annual \nglobal resource use has surpassed 100 billion tonnes \nand inequalities have widened across and within \ncountries—and it is now over 1-degree warmer than \nin pre-industrial times. We’ve done the maths; now \nit’s time to examine our key findings and implement \nsolutions that can guide businesses, cities and \nnations in becoming more circular. This way, they \ncan reach the ultimate goal of contributing to a \nsocially just and ecologically safe space. This edition \ndraws on five years of knowledge to show the power \nof the circular economy to equitably fulfil our global \nneeds and wants, but with radically fewer materials \nand emissions. There is no time to lose.\n50 years since the Club of Rome warning,  \nten years of circular economy moving towards \nthe mainstream and five years  \nof the Circularity Gap Report .\nAs society has extracted and consumed the Earth’s \nnatural resources at alarming rates—tripling in the last \nhalf century—warning calls have surfaced repeatedly. \nFifty years ago the Club of Rome’s landmark book Limits \nto Growth  predicted that rapid economic growth and \nnatural resource exploitation would lead to the ‘collapse \nof civilisation’ by 2040. 5 And new research 6 shows that \nwe appear to be, unfortunately, right on schedule. A \nhandful of the study’s ‘worst-case scenarios’ based on \nfood production and pollution, among others, have \naccurately forecasted our real-world situation. The new \nconclusions appear to confirm that we only have the \nnext decade to change course.\nPhoto by Max Ravier\nIn the years since the Limits to Growth predictions, we \nhave seen tremendous progress on the sustainability \nor ‘green’ front with a medley of environmental \nvictories. However, we can’t downplay our defeats. \nTake the Paris Agreement, a great example of globally-\ncoordinated action on climate breakdown. In 2015, \nnearly all countries pledged to limit the average global \ntemperature rise this century to well below 2-degrees \nin an effort to prevent the worst impacts of climate \nbreakdown, provide support for lower-income nations \nand be transparent in reporting on action. Things \ncould only get better—or so was the presumption. It is \nnow clear, though, that the blueprints mapped out for \nthe globe in the form of national climate promises—\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—were \nnever powerful enough to fulfil the Agreement’s goal \nof limiting warming temperatures to safe levels. Next \nto this, the funding pledged to lower-income nations \nwas staggeringly slow and low. Many pinned their \nhopes on COP26 in Glasgow to deliver meaningful \nimpacts, but outcomes were branded a ‘fragile \nwin’ by COP President Alok Sharma. While the 2015 \nParis Agreement upped the global ambition with an \nagreement on binding climate commitments, Glasgow \nfailed to deliver on its ultimate target: firmly closing \nthe gap to 1.5-degree with the same level of binding \nagreements. It did, however, reduce the Emissions Gap \nas some countries boosted their NDCs: now to meet \n1.5-degrees between 19 and 23 billion tonnes of CO 2 \nequivalents must be removed from the atmosphere, \naccording to Climate Action Tracker. The conference \nalso delivered a breakthrough agreement on phasing \nout fossil fuels and commitment to a just transition, it \ndemonstrated great business leadership and published \na range of pledges that will affect the private sector \nfor years to come. It also set rules for carbon markets \nthat could unlock trillions of dollars in climate finance \nto protect forests, build renewable energy facilities \nand more. It, however, once again underperformed on \nramping up finance to lower-income nations—among \nother disappointments.  \nAnalysis shows that even if all original NDCs were \nfulfilled, the world would still warm up by 3.2-degrees \nthis century  7 and if we include all the updates ahead \nof COP26, the world would be on track for 2.4-degree \nwarming this century. This is partly because they \noverwhelmingly focus on the energy transition: \nditching fossil fuels in favour of clean energy, such as \nsolar or wind. Entering COP26, only one-third of all \nnations had any mention of the circular economy in \ntheir pledges, less than 40% included any plans for \n1\n13\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022",

It has \nalso gained impressive traction in the corporate world, \nwith recognised global business leaders endorsing \nthe Reports, such as the CEO of Phillips, and it has \nencouraged a range international companies—from \nconstruction company Rockwool to Europe-wide retailer \nAction—to understand their role in value chains and \nclose their own Circularity Gaps. \nTHE CIRCULAR TRANSITION MUST  \nLOOK BEYOND ITS IMPACT ON RESOURCE \nUSE ALONE\nIn our modern world of interconnected flows across \nborders and rising inequalities, the circular transition \nmust adapt, looking beyond resource use and efficiency \nalone. For a balanced outcome, it must examine its \nlinks with wider environmental issues and social equity. \nResource use is enmeshed with GHG emissions—making \nthe circular economy a powerful tool to cut emissions \nand combat climate breakdown (see more in Chapter \nThree). It is also a multistakeholder model and its \nsystems-thinking approach boosts capacity, cooperation \nand capability to serve universal societal needs. And \nif done well, it can work to reduce inequalities in the \nprocess. It acts as a framework that supports a more \nresource-smart, people-centric future. That is why in \nour five years of the Circularity Gap Report , our focus has \nmirrored this shift: we quantitatively tied the circular \neconomy to GHG emissions and analysed how circular \nstrategies can help countries serve the needs of their \ncitizens in equitable and sustainable ways (see more in  \nChapter Four). \nFrom circular, to linear and back again:  \nthe Earth’s journey.\nFrom the four seasons to day becoming night, our \nplanet Earth functions in a naturally circular manner—\nand has done so for billions of years. In nature, there \nis no waste: all materials have value and are used to \nsustain life in a myriad of ways. Natural processes are \nrun from renewable energy: the oak tree, for example, \nconsumes sunlight to create sugar, which allows acorns \nto grow—precious food for squirrels. The discarded \nacorn casings then become nutrients for decomposers, \nsuch as worms, which turn them into soil. Even as our \nhuman ancestors arrived on the planet, most of their \nactivities were driven by muscle power: be it human \nor animal. Growing or sourcing materials, and building \ntraining to support their implementation and now the \nupdated Pact continues the overwhelming focus on \ncutting fossil fuels—namely coal—as the primary means \nto cut emissions. This results in efforts centred solely on \nenergy sources in industries with high greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions: namely electricity, heat, construction, \ntransportation and manufacturing. Although vital, is this \nalone enough to stem climate breakdown? The answer \nhere is no. We need to explore truly sustainable and \ntransformative alternatives with a wider, more holistic \nimpact to accompany the clean energy transition—that \nalso targets our rising consumption levels and considers \ntraining people to support the transition. Egypt is due \nto host COP27 in late 2022. Governments must ensure it \ndoes better than COP26.\nTEN YEARS SINCE THE CIRCULAR\nECONOMY MOVED TO BECOMING\nMORE IN THE MAINSTREAM\nThe circular economy is nature’s equivalent of ‘living \nwithin your means.’  Just as living beyond your economic \nmeans can be risky and lead to problems in how you are \nable to operate day to day, living beyond our planetary \nmeans is threatening the planet and how safely it can \nfunction. The circular economy is an alternative: an \napproach for living within the means of our planet, \nwhile still providing for the global population. It does \nthis by putting forward strategies that we can use to \nfulfil societies’ needs with radically fewer materials and \nemissions (see more on page 17). Despite a rich history \nacross nations and sectors of society, the circular \neconomy only moved from the fringes of academic \nthought and emerged in mainstream policy discourse \nabout ten years ago. It became a complementary model \nto traditional sustainability paradigms, with its more \nsystemic approach: suited to driving change on a large, \nglobal scale. It has also been embraced by businesses as \na means to reach climate and sustainability targets.\nChina’s Circular Economy Promotion Law  in 2008 and \nthe European Commission’s Circular Economy Action \nPlan in 2015 proved particularly noteworthy early \nmilestones. They triggered a flourish of research and \naction and introduced the circular economy to the \nworld’s two largest economies—together accounting \nfor 35% of global GDP and 25% of the global population. \nBusiness engagement has been another determining \ncharacteristic of these last ten years. The Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation’s pioneering reports, including a \nmuch-cited claim of net annual benefits of €1.8 trillion \nin the EU alone, 8 were a major spark for the uptake \nof circular strategies among businesses. Also, in the \nlong-term, a global circular economy that bypasses \nrisks inherent in the linear economy—such as supply \nchain collapse and a failure to innovate in the face of \nnew laws or regulations—would amass more profits. 9 \nThe parameters of the circular economy now feature \nin multiple governmental and multilateral policies \nand goals: from the EU Green Deal  and the EU Circular \nEconomy Action Plan , to the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs). It is also front and centre for many \nsustainability-focused business-led coalitions, such as \nthe New Plastics Economy and the Capital Equipment \nCoalition, among many others. The circular economy \nis also now increasingly coupled with resilience in calls \nfor ‘building back better’ since the onset of the covid-19 \npandemic.\nFIVE YEARS OF THE CIRCULARITY GAP \nREPORT : MEASURING WHAT MATTERS\nAs the circular economy increasingly moved into the \nmainstream, we at Circle Economy saw that something \nwas missing: measurements and metrics.  Measuring \nthe mass of global consumption—the world’s material \nfootprint—is the DNA of the  Circularity Gap Reports . The \nfirst-ever report in 2018 launched the alarming statistic \nthat the globe was only 9.1% circular—with a Circularity \nGap of 90.9%. 10 Our analysis showed the world which \nsocietal needs and wants—from Nutrition to Housing to \nMobility—consume which resources (see more on page \n19). Our x-ray of global material use (see pages 22-23) \nillustrates what happens to products and materials after \nthey have been used. In particular, it uncovers the tiny \nflow of resources cycled back into the economy—now \nonly 8.6%—and helps us estimate how much material \nis wasted beyond recovery. This exposes how deeply \nour linear system is still ingrained in our daily lives. \nThe graphic visualisation has been adopted by many \nmainstream outlets, such as National Geographic, \nThe New Scientist and the UN’s Global Environmental \nOutlook for Business—to illustrate the severity of our \nsituation.\nThe Circularity Metric filled a critical space in the circular \neconomy discourse at the time: answering the need for \nmeasurement. Capturing the circularity of the world in \none number allowed us to track and target performance \nand identify the key global levers for systemic change, \nthereby providing guidance for future action. The \nCircularity Gap Report for nations was born and a host of \ncountries have since embarked on a journey to measure \ntheir circularity, identifying their most impactful \nand transporting products, required hard labour. For \nthis reason, produced goods were extremely valuable \nand circular economy practices such as reuse were \ncommonplace. Even ceramics, made from clay and \ntherefore available in abundance, were frequently \nrecycled, food leftovers and agricultural residues were \nused to fertilise crops, excrement to tan leather, and \nurine to dye fabrics. 11 For the most part, early human \nsocieties’ existence hinged on careful resource use and \nmanagement—necessitating respect for the natural \nenvironment. Some societies today still use traditional, \nand inherently circular, practices: but the majority \nof the world has pivoted far away. Enter the linear \neconomy.\nA LINEAR ECONOMY: FROM SCARCITY  \nTO ABUNDANCE; MUSCLE POWER TO \nMACHINE POWER\nIn some parts of the world, the Industrial Revolution \nbegan around the 18th century. From 1750 to 1953, \nworld manufacturing output increased 24-fold 12—\nbut this growth was concentrated in a few locations, \nprimarily empire-building nations located in Europe, \nas well as the US. These counties swiftly traded out \nmuscle power for machines, which allowed for goods \nto be mass-produced, from the sewing machine to \nrailroad equipment. These products were then shipped \naround the world, in a process powered by fossil fuels. \nAs industrialisation spread, colonies overseas became \nthe markets for new products—but were also heavily \nexploited for raw materials to feed further production. \nEconomic growth in such countries was also impeded \nas imperial powers stifled competition; Portugal, for \nexample, banned most cloth manufacturing in colonial \nBrazil for decades in the late 18th century 13—just one \nof many examples of how social inequalities grew in \ntandem with environmental degradation. Over this \nperiod, the use of natural resources, including fossil \nfuels, increased tremendously and has continued to \nincrease at an exponential rate.\nNow and for the past 200 years, the hallmark of global \nconsumption and resource-use can be aptly described \nas ‘take-make-waste’: a linear economy. The end of \ncolonisation and its stifling policies in the 19th century \nmeant a wider range of countries, from China to Brazil \nand India, could undertake industrial schemes and \nalso rapidly begin using fossil fuels to boost their \neconomies and scale their production.  \n2\n15\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n14\n",

      "content": "The world’s mission was to produce more and grow \neconomically, and for consumers to consume.  \nIn feeding our hungry appetites we have stripped \nthe Earth of life-sustaining systems such as forests, \nhealthy oceans, rich soil and clean air and replaced \nthem with swathes of monocultured land and concrete \njungles. Whilst the linear economic model has enabled \nvast growth and rising wealth across many parts of \nthe world, basic living standards remain unmet in \nothers. Now, in many parts of the world, much of our \nconsumption has become unrelated to meeting  \nhuman needs. 14\nGrowth in consumption was also inevitably tied to \nwaste. As the linear economy began to take hold, \nplanned obsolescence that artificially shortens \nproducts’ lifespans became commonplace from the \n1930s onwards, leading to a peak in consumer waste \ngeneration. 15 Recycling, which experienced a ‘golden \nage’ more than 130 years ago, decreased pre-World \nWar I and didn’t return to full force until the 1990s: 16  \nIt wasn’t only consumerism spiralling, but also rubbish \ngoing to landfill. And what’s more, our analysis found \nthat between the 19th and 21st centuries, global \nresource use climbed from 7 billion tonnes a year to \nover 100 billion tonnes.\nLET’S FAST-FORWARD TO THE  \nPRESENT: 2022\nIn the past half-century, the world’s population has \nmore than doubled, 17 yet the amount of material \nflowing through the economy has more than tripled, \nfrom 27 billion tonnes in 1970 to 84 billion tonnes in \n2015.18 And in 2021, we reached a worrying milestone: \nthe mass of human-made things, from pavements \nto apartments to phones, was found to outweigh all \nliving beings and biomass, such as our oceans, trees \nand animals. 19 Artificial objects have gone from just 3% \nof the world’s biomass in 1900 to on par with it today. \nOur use of natural resources to make more ‘stuff’ is not \npredicted to slow down and looks set to increase from \n100 to between 170 and 184 billion tonnes by 2050. \nThe events of 2020 also served to hold a magnifying \nglass to the flaws in our system as the covid-19 \npandemic swept the world. It exposed our linear \neconomy as extremely vulnerable to shocks. Yet it \nalso served to show how fast changes can occur in \ntimes of crisis:  governments were admirably swift in \nresponding with safety nets of huge proportions for \npeople’s welfare, jobs and health.  \nYet governments have failed to use this global event \nas an opportunity to pivot to a system where societal \nand environmental health is prioritised over economic \ngrowth. A United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) report confirmed that of the $14.6 trillion \nspent on preventing economic collapse during the \npandemic, a huge portion went toward bail-outs for \npolluting industries, such as oil and airlines. 20 It was \ndisappointing that no green conditions were attached \nto the financial support, which could have encouraged \naction toward net-zero emission targets or investment \nin long-term technological development. And now, \ndespite GHG emissions dropping by 6% during the \npandemic, they were projected to exceed 2019 levels \nin 2020 by 4% across the G20 as fossil-fuel use spirals \nupward—despite governments preaching green \npromises and envisioning net-zero dreams. 21\nWe could not be further away from the natural, \nbalanced and circular origin of the world.\nTHE\nCIRCULAR\nECONOMY\nCircularity gives us the tools to transform our linear economy into one \nwhere waste and pollution are eliminated, products and materials are \nreused and nature is regenerated. If we integrate circular strategies into \nour economies based on the four flows below, we will ultimately require \nfewer materials and emissions to live. \nNARROW:  USE LESS\nBy minimising the overall material inputs into an economy, the \nemissions present in resources and end-products lowers: especially \nif priorityis given to the flows with the highest embodied emissions.\nIn practice: Sharing and rental models,material lightweighting, \nmultifunctional productsor buildings, energy efficiency, digitisation.\nSLOW : USE LONGER\nIn extending the functional lifetime of resources, the emissions \nattached to material flows are spread out and reduced over time.\nIn practice: Durable material use, modular design, design  \nfor disassembly, repair, remanufacturing, refurbishing,  \nrenovation,remodelling.\nREGENERATE : MAKE CLEAN\nIn using regenerative resources, the emissions in fossil fuels  \nand unsustainable biomass are cut from the economy.  \nIn practice: Regenerative material use, renewable energy,  \nregenerative agriculture.\nCYCLE:  USE AGAIN\nDepending on the energy used and emissions released during  \ncycling, this strategy has the potential to eliminate embodied \nemissions from inputs.

And as we do more—\nbe it travelling, buying goods and even eating—we \nuse more resources. Of the 100 billion tonnes of \nresources that the world uses every year, only 8.6% \nis cycled back into our economy: over 90% of what \nwe take from the earth to fulfil our needs and wants \ngoes to waste—our throwaway society in practice. \nIn our first report in 2018, we introduced these \nfigures in a material x-ray of our global economy, \nwhich visualised the global material footprint that \nlies behind meeting our key needs and wants, be \nthey Nutrition or Housing. The x-ray depicts these \n‘hidden currents of our lives—the massive flows \nof raw materials and products deployed, to such \na wonderful and damaging effect, by 7.7 billion \nhumans. Our shared metabolism, you might say,’  \nto quote National Geographic’s coverage of our \nCircularity Gap Report 2020 . This chapter dives into \nthe material x-ray and what this tells us about why \nglobal circularity has reduced from 9.1% to 8.6% in \nonly two years.\nFROM PARIS TO GLASGOW...\nmore than half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials were \nconsumed; and the Circularity Gap got worse, not better. \nOn top of this, resource extraction is forecast to almost \ndouble between now and 2050. \nIn only six years, the world economy consumed an \nadditional half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials, \nnamely minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass.  \nThese enormous volumes of materials—by and large \nwasted after use—are climbing year on year. Ultimately, \nwaste is connected to most environmental problems, \nfrom biodiversity loss, global warming and air pollution \nto plastic soup.\nThe covid-19 pandemic led to rapid behavioural  \nchanges and government decisions that occurred  \nalmost overnight. However, we failed to see a \ntransformation of consumption patterns: material \nextraction and global emissions only showed a very \nminor and temporary decline. Already at the end of \n2021, we witnessed soaring energy prices because \ndemand for energy and materials increased so sharply, \nwhile GHG emissions also soared. 22\nMore structurally, in only 50 years, global material use \nhas nearly quadrupled—outpacing population growth. 23 \nIn 1972, as the Club of Rome’s Limits to Growth was \npublished, the world consumed 28.6 billion tonnes. \nAt the turn of the Millenium, this had gone up to \n54.9 billion tonnes and as of 2019, it surpassed 100 \nbillion tonnes. Accompanying the rapid acceleration \nof consumption is rising waste levels: ultimately, over \n90% of all extracted and used materials end up as \nwaste. On the flip side, only 8.6% makes it back into our \neconomy.\nThis rate of extraction continues to threaten the \nplanet’s future—and our lives on it. Yet forecasts paint \na grim future: according to the International Resource \nPanel, material use may increase to between 170 \nand 184 billion tonnes in 2050 if business as usual \nprevails. 24 \nThe circular economy provides a framework for \ndecoupling growth from material extraction: it can \ncreate the conditions for sustainable development, \nmeeting the needs of the growing population without \nrelying on the use of primary resources.\n21\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022",

Looking at Figure Two,  \nwe see both the volume of extracted resources globally \nper year (92.0 billion tonnes) and all of the resources  \nthat were cycled (8.65 billion tonnes). This brings  \nthe total of material inputted into the economy to  \n100.6 billion tonnes.\nOf the total material inputs, a hefty chunk (48 billion \ntonnes) went into long-term stock: largely buildings, \ninfrastructure and heavy machinery. From that same \nstock, 17 billion tonnes of materials were removed \nor demolished, leaving a net addition of 31 billion \ntonnes in the year. The materials used for this stock are \nlocked-in and won’t become available for cycling back \ninto the economy until the stock reaches its end-of-use \nphase.

      "content": "FROM 9.1% TO 8.6% CIRCULAR:\nWHAT’S GOING ON?\nOnly two years after the 9.1% measurement, our \nanalysis found that the circularity of the world had \nfallen to 8.6% (as shown in detail in Figure Two). And \nwe now know that material use is not only increasing, \nbut accelerating beyond even population growth.  \nSince 1970, the American population has grown by \n60%, disproportionately accompanied by an increase in \nconsumer spending of 400%: a trend common among \nnations with an expanding middle class. 25 \nThe negative shift overall can be explained by two \nrelated, underlying trends:\nOur growth rate of resource extraction \noutpaces improvements in efficiency and \nin end-of-use recovery by a factor of two \nto three—and as a result, the quantities of \nsecondary materials available for use are \nfalling short.\nOur capacity for recovery and recycling fails to \nmatch current rates of consumption. While in \nmany parts of the world recovery is on the rise—\nsteered by comprehensive government policy and \ntechnical innovation and investment—our capacity \nfor reuse can’t match our need for resources. By \nway of illustration: solid waste recovery in Europe \nincreased, on average, by 11% between 2011 and \n2016, with countries such as Sweden, Austria and \nLuxembourg leading the way and boasting recovery \nrates above 80%—but extraction continues. 26 And \nin the Netherlands, a circular frontrunner, the use of \nnatural resources is barely declining despite efficiency \nincreasing—be it designing a plastic bottle to have a \nlighter cap, or reducing the amount of pulp required to \nmake a ream of office paper. 27 \nUltimately, our limited capacity to cycle  materials at \nan equal level around the world means that quantities \nof secondary materials available for reuse fall short: \nwe still need huge amounts of virgin materials to \nsatisfy our lifestyles. Overall material consumption \nmust also be reduced to narrow  flows: if the common \ndenominator (consumption of primary materials) \nkeeps growing, our advances in material efficiency and \ncycling can never keep up. The processes still entail \nresource extraction.\nTo serve the needs of a growing population, \nwe keep extracting materials to build \nhousing, infrastructure and heavy \nmachinery—we should make use of what  \nis already there.  \nCountries are continually investing in new buildings \nand infrastructure to meet a variety of societal needs. \nCurrent estimates suggest that 255 billion square \nmetres of buildings exist across the globe—a figure \nexpected to almost double within the next four \ndecades. This is equal to erecting cities the size of Paris \nevery week. 28 This stock build-up is not inherently \nbad; many nations need to invest to ensure access to \nbasic services, particularly in Build and Grow countries \n(see Chapter Four). But as our global population \nis projected to swell to 9.9 billion over the next 30 \nyears and land-use concerns come to the fore, we’re \nincreasingly building up . This is concerning as tall \nbuildings are inherently unsustainable: skyscrapers \nrequire extra resources for foundational and structural \nsupport: namely, cement. 29 Cement use is extremely \nemissions-intensive but demand continues to rise. 30 \nAlso, increasing renewable energy generation, \ndistribution and storage capacity to regenerate  \nenergy flows will entail building up infrastructure, \nsuch as wind turbines or electrical grids. Fortunately, \nthis is happening at scale: G20 members have set new \nrecords in building capacity for solar and wind power—\nnearly doubling the amount of wind power produced in \n2020 compared to 2019. 31 \nRegardless, when materials, mostly minerals and \nores, are invested into stock in the form of buildings, \ninfrastructure and heavy machinery, they become \nembedded and unavailable as secondary materials \nfor as long as they remain stored and in use. It is, \ntherefore, paramount that virgin resources are not \nextracted to continue building up this stock, but  \nrather that we design, produce, maintain and reuse \nbuildings, roads and machinery in a circular manner  \nto cycle flows. \nChapter Three outlines circular economy strategies \nthat can reduce our overall resource extraction and \nconsumption by 28%—allowing us to make the most of \nimprovements in efficiency, product design, recycling \nand reuse, so as to narrow, slow, regenerate and \ncycle flows as a result. With this reduction in global \nemissions by 22.8 billion tonnes, we can close the \nEmissions Gap and keep warming temperatures to \n1.5-degrees. \nFROM A MASS FOCUS TO VALUE AND \nCARBON: THE MASS, VALUE, CARBON \n(MVC) NEXUS\nThe circular economy is a big picture and holistic idea. \nUltimately, it is a means to an end—the end being a \nsocially just and ecologically safe space. But to  \nreach this goal, we have to look at more than only \nresource flows. In our 2019 report, we introduced \nthe Mass-Value-Carbon (MVC) nexus, a concept that \nlooks at how much greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \n(Carbon) and value-created (Value) are distributed \nthrough meeting our key societal needs and wants with \nmaterials (Mass). The MVC became the starting point \nfor a more holistic view of our economy.\nOur 2021 Report built on this MVC concept and \nprofoundly deepened our exploration; scrutinising \nhow global GHG emissions arise from the extraction, \nprocessing and use of resources, and paving the way \nfor a set of solutions that cut both resource extraction \nand use and GHG emissions.

      "content": "THE\nLINK\nCIRCU-\nLARITY-\nCLIMATE\n3\nThree consecutive Circularity Gap Reports  were \ndevoted to answering the question of how circular \nthe global economy is and identifying the key \nlevers to move us towards circularity—with a focus \non mass. Initially, our inspiration came from the \nUN’s Emissions Gap reports—and for our 2021 \nanalysis, the Emissions Gap returned to the fore, as \nwe undertook the task of quantifying how closing \nthe Circularity Gap could also help to close the \nEmissions Gap. We found that our climbing rates \nof resource use are responsible for catapulting \nbillions of tonnes of human-made (greenhouse \ngases) GHGs into our atmosphere—70% of \nemissions, to be precise. In 2019 alone, we emitted \n59.1 billion tonnes of GHGs to satisfy global \nneeds and wants. 32 Our Circularity Gap Report \n2021 quantitatively mapped how GHG emissions \nand resources move through our economy, from \nextraction to end-of-use. In uncovering the \nsynergistic relationship between resource use and \nGHG emissions, we now present a roadmap of 21 \ncircular solutions for the world that can transform \nour use of materials and cut emissions.\nFor a decade, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) has highlighted the Emissions Gap \nevery year. The Emissions Gap assesses the level\nof GHGs that will be emitted if we continue to \nplunder along a business as usual path that includes \ncurrent Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), \ncompared to the level we must limit emissions to keep \nglobal temperature rise below 2-degrees, and ideally \n1.5-degrees. The Emissions Gap that is referred to \nin this report is defined in reference to a 1.5-degree \ntrajectory to be achieved by 2032, thereby meeting  \nthe goal of staying well below 2-degrees of warming, \nand ideally 1.5-degrees, as specified by the  \nParis Agreement.\nTO CLOSE BOTH THE EMISSIONS AND \nCIRCULARITY GAPS, WE NEED TO LOOK \nBEYOND CLEAN ENERGY\nNet-zero and decarbonisation promises have never \nbeen more prevalent—yet despite the headline-\ngrabbing claims of governments, the use of coal \nis predicted to rise by 5% in 2021 alone in G20 \ncountries. 33 Not only is climate action disappointing, \nbut so are pledges for action. The vast majority of \nNDCs crafted during the Paris Agreement in 2015 and \nupdated for COP26—which have the aim of keeping \nwarming global temperature below 2-degrees and \nideally 1.5-degrees—fell overwhelmingly short of the \ngoal. They hardly mention resource extraction, use \nor consumption rates and only one-third allude to \nthe circular economy. Instead, the focus was largely \non the clean energy transition: ditching fossil fuels \nin favour of energy sources such as solar or wind. \nThis resulted in efforts centred on energy sources in \nindustries with high GHG emissions: namely electricity, \nheat, construction, transportation and manufacturing. \nAlthough the energy transition is hugely important, \nit’s not the only way to cut emissions, and as the initial \nNDCs showed, it’s not impactful enough alone. \nBased on the material x-ray, in Figure Two, from our \nformative reports, our 2021 Report mapped this \nx-ray agaisnt how GHGs flow through our economy. \nThis uncovered how the vast majority of GHG \nemissions (70%) are ultimately generated through \nmaterial handling and use—be it the clothes we \nwear, the phones we own or the meals we eat. This \ndemonstrated how important it is to consider resource \nuse—and consumption levels—in our efforts to cut \nglobal GHG emissions. As circular economy strategies \nultimately prioritise material value-retention and \ncut excessive consumption, they can be extremely \neffective in cutting GHG emissions. This is how  \nclosing the Circularity Gap, can help to close the \nEmissions Gap.\nEMISSIONS AND MATERIAL-INTENSIVE \nNEEDS: MOBILITY, HOUSING AND \nNUTRITION \nIn analysing and illustrating how 59.1 billion tonnes of \nemissions flow along and across global value chains in \nan emissions x-ray, we gained a deeper understanding \nof the upstream drivers of global emissions and which \nsocietal needs and wants generate the most emissions. \nAfter establishing that 70% of all global emissions were \ntied to resource use and handling, we were left with \nthe question: which needs and wants should we focus \non to make the deepest reductions possible?\nEnacted globally, a  \ncircular economy can help  \nclose the Emissions Gap\nPhoto by Damir Omerovic\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022",

This is because some interventions, when \ncombined, will partially cancel each other out. For \nexample, in ‘Reduce floor space’, we also reduce \nthe volumes of construction and demolition waste \n(C&DW) that become available for recycling and \nrepurposing. Another example is the absolute impact \nof lightweighting the global car fleet in ‘Vehicle \ndesign improvements’, which is directly moderated \nby the size of the said fleet, which in turn is reduced \nby, for instance, car sharing. This dynamic between \ninterventions and the extent of their overlaps is \nvisually depicted by the boxes. \nFor each solution, the figure shows its potential to \nreduce GHG emissions as the width of the intervention \n‘box’, and the material footprint reduction by the \nheight of the box. The image shows the contribution \nof each intervention separately, as well as for all \ninterventions combined. \n21 CIRCULAR SOLUTIONS FOR A  \n1.5-DEGREE PATHWAY\nFigure Three on the next page shows how a roadmap \nof 21 interventions across six scenarios can mitigate \nclimate impact by curbing GHG emissions. We did \nnot model interventions specially for the societal \nneed of Services as the materials used and emissions \nreleased in performing such Services are included in \nother categories. For example, repair interventions—\nclassified as a service—are addressed under most of\nthe other needs and wants. Encompassing actions \nfor businesses, cities and nations, the 21 solutions \nprovide input for a more profound and fundamental \ntransformation of the economy than the current \npathways that make up the vast majority of NDCs. \nThis set of 21 circular strategies can keep the planet on \na 1.5-degree trajectory by cutting emissions by  \n22.8 billion tonnes beyond what is achieved by the \nupdated climate commitments: a 39% reduction from \n2019 levels.\nTogether, the combined interventions can almost \ndouble the current global Circularity Metric of 8.6%, \nbringing it to 17%. This results in:\n• Shrinking global material use and  \nextraction by 28%. \n• Cutting global GHG emissions by 39%—fully \nclosing the Emissions Gap as defined in our report \nand taking into account the updated NDCs.\n• Allowing the world to achieve the Paris \nAgreement’s goal of keep at 1.5-degrees of \nwarming by 2032.* \n*If we implement all segments of the roadmap, as well as \nconditional and unconditional NDCs, as they stood in 2021,  \nby 2032, and then continue decreasing emissions at more or  \nless the same pace to reach net-zero by 2050. \n31\nThe Circularity Gap Report  202230\n",

National and \nlocal governments will need to provide direction \nand enabling conditions, consumers will need \nto make choices that encourage circularity and \nbusinesses will need to redesign their processes \nand products from the ground up.\nNations and their governments essentially establish \nthe ‘rules of the game’ at the national level through \npolicy or ambitious target setting.

They are also hubs of infrastructure, \ninnovation, manufacturing and business, and are \nthus crucial locations in which circular economy \nactions must take place. Even in cases where national \ngovernments may not provide suitable enabling \nconditions for circularity, there are a number of ways \nin which city governments can integrate and support \nit through their policies and day-to-day decisions \nand operations (public procurement, for example). \nLocal governments often have jurisdiction over waste \ncollection, public transport networks, urban planning \nand local economic development, and are in many \ncases able to implement impactful changes more \nrapidly than national governments can. The Mayor of \nLondon, for example, has set an ambitious target for \nLondon to reach net-zero emissions by 2030, 20 years \nearlier than the UK government’s goal. 34 They are also \nbetter positioned to engage with local businesses, \nnonprofits and community organisations to align their \nefforts toward circularity goals.

Translating these \nglobal interventions to the national level must take \ninto account carbon inequality. Nearly half (48%) of \ncumulative CO 2 emissions over the last quarter century \ncan be attributed to the richest 10% of the globe, \nwhilst the poorest 50% were responsible for only \n7%.36 Over the past few decades, the global carbon \nbudget has largely been spent by the consumption of \nthe rich and has failed to lift other areas of the world \nout of poverty. And in a cruel irony, this emissions \ninequality also has another side: lower-income nations \nwho contribute the fewest emissions are also most \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate breakdown. Such \nnations are still fighting to receive adequate climate \nfinancing from richer nations, following the failure of \nCOP26 on this front.\nOur 2021 report presented the emissions and \nmaterial footprint of three different country profiles, \nBuild, Grow and Shift, (see pages 40-42) in absolute \nterms from a consumption perspective. It found \nthat Build countries are home to the greatest share \nof the globe’s population but are only responsible \nfor 17% of emissions—yet most at risk for climate \ninduced disasters. Grow countries, home to rapidly \nindustrialising populations, produce 47% of global \nemissions and 51% of global resource extraction. \nMeanwhile Shift counties, which house a minority of \nthe global population, produce the largest share of \nemissions and account for one-third (31%) of all global \nresource extraction.\nPhoto by Eberhard Grossgasteiger\n35\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n34\n",

Each country must tailor \nthe roadmap of 21 circular solutions to suit their \ncontext and populations. If we don’t tailor solutions \nfor different countries and incorporate social and \nethical considerations in the circular economy \ntransition, we risk repeating the same mistakes \nof the linear economy—which has often relied on \nexploiting people and the planet.\nIn all Circularity Gap Reports , ethical considerations \nand trade-offs that could potentially arise in the \ncircular transition have been a careful consideration. \nThe circular economy must not perpetuate the same \nmistakes as the linear economy. We, therefore, \npinpoint the seven core societal needs and wants \nthat guide our research: Housing, Nutrition, Mobility, \nCommunications, Services, Consumables and \nHealthcare (see page 19). The global roadmap must be \nresource-efficient, but also people-centric; the impact \nof one circular strategy can have vastly different \nrepercussions on communities in different localities \nand this must be taken into account. \nConsider this: although a healthy diet requires 2,000 \ncalories per day for a typical female, the intake in \nsome countries may be far higher, while malnutrition \npersists in others. The more calorie-intensive diets \ncould consist of out-of-season, imported foods that \nhave travelled across the globe, or high levels of animal \nprotein. Calling to reduce consumption here may be \nappropriate and even ethical, but less so in cases \nwhere access to basic nutritious food is limited. The \ncircular economy is also about achieving a structural \nand cultural shift where we can satisfy everyone’s \nuniversal needs within the boundaries of the planet—\nbut there are important differences between countries \nand regions to take into consideration.\nCircular solutions can help\nmove countries toward a\nsafe and just space\nPhoto by Manish Tulaskar \nNO COUNTRY IS WITHIN A SAFE  \nAND JUST SPACE\nCountries all exist on a spectrum, which we measured \nin our 2020 Report along two dimensions:  \nthe Human Development Index (HDI) and Ecological \nFootprint (which measures humanity’s demand \non ecosystems). 37 In an ideal world, all countries \nwould have strong HDI scores and a low Ecological \nFootprint—providing for the needs of their citizens \nwithin the means of the planet. Currently, no country \nhas created this ecologically safe and socially just \nspace for humanity. Figure Five on the next page \ndemonstrates how no one country has reached the \n‘safe and just’ space. We all have work to do and the \ncircular economy can play a pivotal role.\nCountries that score high on HDI have stable \ngovernments, widespread education and healthcare, \nhigh life expectancies, and growing, powerful \neconomies. Low scores indicate unstable governments, \nwidespread poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and \npoor education. They often also have low incomes and \nlow life expectancies, coupled with high birth rates. \nSome countries occupy spaces in between. \nImplementing the circular economy must recognise \nthat different approaches are appropriate in different \ncontexts to ensure local needs are met, while limiting \nthe environmental impacts of associated resource use.\nA\n37\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022",

      "content": "BUILD\nBuild countries—such as India and Ethiopia—struggle \nto meet the needs of their populations, from education \nto healthcare. While their citizens live within planetary \nboundaries, these countries are characterised by low  \nHDI rankings. Although it has been on a steady decline \nfor the last two decades, poverty is widespread \nand covid-19 sparked a surge in extreme poverty in \nBuild countries. 38 These countries are also especially \nvulnerable to extreme weather events that will \nthreaten lives and damage livelihoods and sectors \nranging from agriculture to the built environment. \nMeasures that build up resilience are particularly called \nfor—especially as populations grow and governments \nstrive for increased industrialisation. \nWhile the position of Build countries is precarious,  \nit’s also full of opportunity: as they develop  \ninfrastructure and work to meet the needs of their \ncitizens, there is a chance to bypass the degrading \nprocesses employed by Grow and Shift countries,  \ninstead applying circular models. \nREVISITING TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE, \nBRIDGING THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP\nWidespread desertification and forest loss have \nencouraged many Sub-Saharan Africa populations \nto switch from traditional roofing techniques—using \nmud and timber—to corrugated iron sheets and sawn \ntimber beams—which have inadequate thermal and \nacoustic insulation and they can further accelerate \ndeforestation. The association for Voute Nubienne \n(Nubian Vault) has established a programme in \nBurkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou (and has recently \nexpanded to Mali, Senegal and Togo) that promotes an \nancient architectural technique to construct timberless \nvaulted roofs, which protect during the rainy season, \nstay cool during hot days and radiate heat back at \nnight. The programme teaches villagers to make \nthis roofing themselves using readily available local \nmaterials, thereby meeting local housing needs with a \nlow-carbon option that also helps to prevent further \ndeforestation. 39\nIn some Build countries, up to 45% of harvested fresh \nfruits and vegetables can go to waste—mainly due \nto lack of cold storage. 40 Reducing food waste—and \nproviding affordable solutions for farmers in  \nNigeria—is ColdHubs: a post-harvest, solar-powered, \ncooling-as-service solution in Nigeria. By offering an \noption for storing and preserving perishable foods that \nadequately meets the financial needs of smallholder \nfarmers, ColdHubs is a solution to the issue of \npost-harvest losses of fruits, vegetables and other \nperishable food. The company offers farmers a flexible \npay-as-you-store subscription model at rates that \nthey can afford, helping to tackle the barrier of access \nto financing for cold chain solutions and bridging the \ntechnological gap for smallholder farmers.\nAs India’s population grows and urbanisation \nincreases, energy consumption in buildings is \nexpected to grow in tandem. The Indian government \nhas implemented policy schemes to mainstream \nsustainable practices: appliance standards, mandatory \nlabelling and certification, energy efficiency \nrequirements and utility demand-side management \nprogrammes. Buildings have minimum requirements \nfor heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, \nand the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has \nimplemented several programmes on using renewable \nenergy in buildings. 41\nFinally, many Build countries lack access to the \ntechnologies and investments required to transition \nfrom artisanal to industrial recycling operations. To \naddress this issue, the African Development Bank \nis financing the implementation of a plastic waste \ncollection and recycling infrastructure in Ivory \nCoast. Using innovative recycling technologies, this \noperation not only provides local industries with raw \nmaterials, but also supports the social and economic \nreintegration of 2,000 ex-combatants. 42\nGROW\nGrow countries—like China and Brazil—are rapidly \nindustrialising: while they don’t yet match the wealth \nof Shift countries, or have HDI rankings as high, their \neconomies are growing exponentially. They’ve lifted \nsignificant proportions of their populations out of \npoverty in recent years—fostering a growing middle \nclass—yet social mobility remains relatively low. While \nit could take a family two generations to transition \nfrom low- to middle-income in a socially mobile \ncountry, for example, in Brazil it may take nine: 43 so \nwhile extreme poverty is less prevalent, much of these \ncountries’ wealth remains locked in the middle class. \nGrow countries’ quick-paced growth is matched by a \nneed for resources: they account for more than half of \nthe world’s resource extraction and a little under half \nof global emissions. \nLABOUR PROTECTION FOR WASTE \nPICKERS, SMARTER WASTE MANAGEMENT\nWork outside of the formal economy (for example, \nwaste picking) is common in some Grow countries—\nbut still, many waste pickers lack social status and \nlabour protection. In Mexico, Danone has built a \nsorting centre outside the landfill where waste pickers \ncan sort waste more efficiently and safely. As a result, \nover 400 families have seen their income rise by 30% \nand their health care covered. 44\nMeanwhile, Brazil touts a social business, Rede Asta, \nthat helps divert waste from Brazil’s vast landfills—\neach day about 175,000 tonnes of solid waste is \ncollected around the country, only an estimated \n2.7% of which is recycled. 45 The women-led initiative \ncollects the waste and unused equipment of hundreds \nof companies and offers them bespoke designs \nusing the discarded materials—often being used for \nthe company’s marketing purposes, for example. \nThis scalable approach is made possible through a \nnationwide network of artisans, with Rede Asta acting \nas a matchmaker to facilitate new sales opportunities. \nOver in São Paulo, outdoor advertising has been \nbanned—making space for street art, community \nnotice boards and trees instead. This move has \nencouraged a needed shift toward more sustainable \nlifestyles by reducing consumption, a reduction in \nvisual pollution and improving aesthetics and air \nquality for communities. 46\nIn Bogatá, Colombia, the circular economy is driving \nsmarter wastewater management in a bid to return \nthe Bogatá river to its former glory. Since the 1950s, \nthe river has faced wastewater discharges from \ndomestic and industrial sources, as well as from \nurban runoff and the dumping of solid waste, leading \nto water so polluted it could no longer supply the \ncity. Now, the city is implementing circular principles \nto spotlight flood control, wastewater management \nand water quality restoration, and the wastewater \ntreatment plant was redesigned with energy efficiency \nand resource recovery at its heart. Now, the plant \ngenerates a significant part of the energy needed for \nits own disinfection treatment processes, for example. \nIn the future, the plant will also produce biosolids and \nreusable wastewater for local agriculture. 47 \nIn another initiative, the city is capturing dangerous \nbiogases emitting from overflowing landfills—and \nproviding vocational training to youth in the process. \nThe Doña Juana Landfill is the first in Colombia to \ncapture landfill biogas and turn it into electricity. In \ncapturing biogas, neighbouring communities are no \nlonger exposed to poisonous gases such as ammonia \nand hydrogen sulfide, protecting especially poor \npopulations living near the landfill. 48\n41\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n40\n",

      "content": "SHIFT\nShift countries—like European countries and the US—\nlargely enjoy high HDI scores, but their citizens live far \nbeyond the planet’s means. It is estimated that if every \nperson were to live and consume like an American, we \nwould need five Earths to sustain our population. 49 \nWhile accounting for a minority of the world, these \ncountries produce 43% of emissions, and account for \nnearly one-third of all resource extraction. While Shift \ncitizens on the whole enjoy comfortable lifestyles \nmarked by often excessive levels of consumption, and \nsocial mobility tends to be high, poverty still exists. \nWhile uncommon, extreme poverty—living on less \nthan US$ 1.90 a day—still afflicts about 0.6% of people \nacross Shift countries. 50 The national poverty lines for \nsuch nations are often around 20 times greater than \nthis international value for extreme poverty. The gap \nbetween rich and poor is widening, too: in the OECD, \nwhich is almost exclusively composed of Shift nations, \nincome inequality is the highest it’s been for the last \nseveral decades. 51 This trend is only set to increase as \nthe costs of housing and other goods are outpacing \nincreases in earnings, putting a tight squeeze on the \ngrowth of the middle class. 52\nSHEDDING CAR-CENTRIC URBAN DESIGN, \nRECYCLE AND REPAIR REIGN\nShift countries have already built up most of their \ninfrastructure—and now, circular strategies centre \non undoing some of the harmful patterns these \nmodes of development have created. Barcelona has \nundertaken an innovative new means for urban living \nto tackle car-centric design: the formation of 400 by \n400 metre ‘superblocks’ that close off small inner \nstreets to through traffic. Only emergency vehicles, \ntransport for the disabled and vehicles for residential \naccess are allowed. The result? A burst of new spaces \nfor pedestrian use and community events, flourishing \nbiodiversity, more sustainable modes of transport—\nlike walking and cycling—and safer, more cohesive \ncommunities. Considered a ‘global best practice’ \nfor urban design that prioritises people over cars, \nBarcelona’s superblocks have caused green spaces’ \npresence in the city to catapult from 0.6% to 11% in \njust one year, and have transformed streets into dining \nspaces, play places and event locales. 53\nAcross the world in Rosario, Argentina, the local \ngovernment has put circular economy strategies \ninto practice to revitalise its economy, address \nfood security crises and reverse unemployment. \nIts UN-lauded Urban Agriculture Program  equipped \nresidents with the tools and knowledge needed to \nstart their own urban farms and gardens. Organic \nand sustainable methods were prioritised, and \nformerly degraded or unused areas—from strips along \nrailways and highways to low-lying land vulnerable to \nflooding—were transformed into fruitful green spaces. \nThe programme was a resounding success: the city saw \nthe formation of 800 gardening groups that provided \nfood to 40,000 residents—as well as a number of \nweekly markets throughout Rosario, boosting social \ncohesion and a sense of community. 54\nMany affluent Shift countries are dominated by \ntake-make-waste consumption models—consumers \npurchase products that often end up in landfill long \nbefore they should. The City of Paris is taking steps to \ncombat this, supporting recycling centres in launching \nreuse centres for consumer goods. The centres also \nrun workshops where Parisians can learn to repair \ntheir household goods—and plans are in the works \nfor an exchange scheme with the private sector to \ngive municipality waste, from furniture to paving \nstones, a second life. Between 2016 and 2018 the \ncentres have diverted more than 2,600 tonnes of \nwaste from landfill—equal to savings of 17%. 55 German \nnon-profit association FairWertung is also aiming to \ngive goods another life—primarily clothing. With a \nfocus on transparency and fairness, the association \nguarantees that donated clothing is properly reused or \ncycled—rather than shipped around the globe before \neventually being discarded. 56\nPhoto by Leonid Danilov\n43\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2022\n42\n",

      "content": "Glasgow did not fully deliver on turning policy into \npractice and talk into action: the months leading \nup to the COP27 in Egypt are therefore pivotal to \nadvance the agenda. At the end of this year, nations \nwill gather in Sharm El Sheikh to present their \nstrengthened targets on emissions cuts. Our last \nfive years of Circularity Gap Reports  have put the \nproblem in stark terms and uncovered the solution: \n21 circular strategies that will slash emissions \nand material use, limit warming and facilitate an \nincreasingly safe and just space for humanity.  \nAside from these solutions for businesses, cities and \nnations, we need urgent, large-scale and high-level \nchange in the five years to come. These changes \nspan three core pillars: digital technology, metrics \nand measurement and social considerations, and \nalso represent Circle Economy’s key contributions  \nto accelerating the circular transition (see on the \nnext page). \nIt’s not easy to put a number on global circularity, and in \ndoing so we must bypass some of the intricacies of the \nglobal economy. But the benefits of having one number \nto guide action and to set a benchmark are manifold. \nWe know that the world’s circularity is in reverse and \nstands at only 8.6%. Our 8.6% economy is wasteful, \npolluting and carbon-intensive. In only six years, half a \ntrillion tonnes of virgin materials were taken from the \nearth to fulfil societal needs and wants: 70% more than \nwhat the earth can safely replenish. Think of the coal \nextracted from the earth’s crust: it’s first processed \nto become petroleum, which feeds into the synthetic \nfibres that weave the fast-fashion clothes we wear and \nquickly dispose of, or the harvested timber that is felled \nin the forest and processed in a sawmill to become the \nfurniture we sit on and then throw away. \nThis Report has presented the key findings of the past \nfive years to demonstrate how the circular economy \nand its rich set of solutions can thoroughly contribute to \nmitigating climate impact and moving the world toward \nan ecologically safe and socially just space.  \nWith 2021’s COP26 yielding mixed outcomes, our \nmessage remains: rallying efforts around renewable \nenergy solutions fails to address the chunk of emissions \n(70%) stemming from resource use and handling.  \nWe need the clean energy transition to happen,  \n5. THE WAY FORWARD\nbut it cannot keep us on the well below 2-degrees \ntrajectory alone. Nor does it tackle our rising \nconsumption levels and concerning resource scarcity. \nIf the world moved away from a linear economy and \ntoward a circular one, our analysis shows that global \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would drop by 39% \nand virgin resource use by 28%, and we would reach \nthe goals of the Paris Agreement.Glasgow did not \ndeliver as many had hoped, so now our attention must \nturn toward COP27 at the end of this year. \nAside from integrating circularity into the actions of \nbusinesses, cities and nations, high-level change must \nbe enacted to create the enabling conditions for a \nmore circular world. We must utilise data-driven tools \nto bring circularity to everyone, use metrics to track \nthe transition and apply a social lens to the transition \nto ensure no one is left behind. \nTHE NEXT FIVE YEARS OF THE CIRCULAR \nTRANSITION NEED AN ENABLING \nENVIRONMENT\n \n1. Data-driven digital tools to bring circularity to everyone. Digital tools \nbased on comprehensive data sets spur knowledge exchange and innovation \nat an exponential rate. Global statistical institutions and governments should \nprioritise frequent—and streamlined—data collection, on both macro and \nmicro levels. They must also collaborate with businesses to make private-\nsector data available for public sector circular decision making and impact \nanalyses. In data-scarce countries or regions,  data alliances can assist in \nfilling the gaps.\nDigital tools can enable knowledge and insights generation along the stages \nof the circular economy transition to explore what is currently happening, \nscan for relevant opportunities, and then act accordingly. Increased \ntransparency in the supply chain, and more data capture at products’ end-of-\nuse will power impactful decision making on where to apply circular strategies \nand get the most impact. Learn more about digital tools powering the circular \ntransition here.\n2. Metrics to track the transition. If we don’t measure, we cannot track \nprogress in a meaningful way, nor can we ultimately locate where the most \nimpactful avenues are. Using data to measure and track circular performance \nacross sectors, businesses, cities and nations will enable actors to set goals, \npeer review, measure and benchmark performance. It will also allow them \nto track progress against their sustainable and circular ambitions or goals \nand to formulate practical pathways aligned to local contexts. Meaningful \nmeasurement also necessitates data, linking to point one above. Learn more \nabout how to track circular performance and measure your benchmark rate \nof circularity here . \n3. A social lens to ensure the transition is safe and just. A holistic circular \neconomy that applies a social lens to all of its activities may help us support \nvarious Sustainable Development Goals, from ending hunger and improving \nhealth and well-being to affordable low-carbon energy, and the opportunity \nfor decent work and economic growth. Potential consequences from one \ncircular solution must be measured to ensure that the transition is safe and \njust for all and that potential blindspots of the circular economy are managed. \nPeople will ultimately drive the circular transition by putting the solutions \ninto practice, and for this reason, government support is needed to invest \nin training and skilling the workforce in preparation. Using data and metrics \nto track and manage how circular jobs are developing across sectors—and \nin relation to our 21 strategies—must guide and be at the foundation of the \ntransition.

Global consumption is 70% higher than the Earth's safe replenishment capacity.  Five years of Circularity Gap Reports reveal that only 8.6% of materials are cycled, leaving a massive Circularity Gap of over 90%.  Global circularity decreased from 9.1% in 2018 to 8.6% in 2020. In 2019, resource consumption reached 100 billion tonnes.  Despite increased business and public interest in climate action, progress needs to accelerate and scale.  Regenerative and ethical behavior must replace extractive and exploitative practices.\n\nA global circular economy can help close the Emissions Gap.  This report demonstrates how a circular economy reduces resource use and emissions while boosting equitable societies. A roadmap of 21 circular solutions can reduce resource extraction and use by 28%, cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 39% and aligning the world with a 1.5-degree pathway.  This requires overcoming linear thinking and abandoning \"business as usual\" behaviors.  Circularity must be a central feature in updating national climate pledges for COP27.  It offers solutions for countries and businesses to meet climate goals, safeguard Earth's resources, and protect all people.  In six years, the global economy consumed an additional half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials, much of which is wasted after use, contributing to environmental problems.  Global material use has nearly quadrupled in 50 years, outpacing population growth.  Over 90% of extracted materials are wasted, and projections show material use potentially increasing to 170-184 billion tonnes by 2050 if current trends continue.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "Global material consumption drastically exceeds Earth's regenerative capacity, widening the Circularity Gap (currently over 90%).  Despite climate pledges, progress is insufficient; only 8.6% of materials are recycled.  A transition to a circular economy, using a proposed roadmap of 21 solutions, could reduce resource extraction by 28% and greenhouse gas emissions by 39%, aligning with 1.5°C climate goals.  This requires abandoning linear economic models and integrating circularity into national climate pledges for COP27.\n",

A MODEL MEANT FOR EARTH: TOWARD AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEM THAT FITS OUR PLANET\n\nThe impact of our throwaway culture is evident in pollution, waste, resource scarcity, biodiversity loss, and rising global temperatures.  A cascade of alarming environmental events highlights the urgency of action.  Climate breakdown could displace millions by 2050 and cause catastrophic biodiversity loss. The sixth IPCC report confirms human activity as the driver of climate change.  Since the first Circularity Gap Report, global circularity has fallen to 8.6% (from 9.1% in 2018), annual global resource use has surpassed 100 billion tonnes, and inequalities have widened.  This report examines key findings and implements solutions to guide businesses, cities, and nations toward becoming more circular, contributing to a socially just and ecologically safe space.  The report leverages five years of knowledge to demonstrate the power of the circular economy to equitably fulfill global needs and wants with radically fewer materials and emissions.\n\nFifty years ago, the Club of Rome's *Limits to Growth* predicted societal collapse by 2040 due to economic growth and resource exploitation.  New research suggests this prediction is accurate. While progress has been made in sustainability, the Paris Agreement's goals remain unfulfilled due to insufficiently ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and slow funding to lower-income nations.  COP26, while achieving some progress (phasing out fossil fuels, carbon market rules, and climate finance mechanisms), fell short of its 1.5-degree target.  Even with updated NDCs, the world is on track for 2.4-degree warming.  The circular economy provides a systemic approach to address these challenges by decoupling growth from material extraction and enabling sustainable development.  \n</chunk>",
      "summary": "The text argues that our current linear economic model is unsustainable, leading to environmental degradation and social inequality.  Despite some progress, global efforts to combat climate change (like the Paris Agreement) are insufficient.  The report advocates for a circular economy as a systemic solution, emphasizing its potential to decouple economic growth from resource depletion and achieve sustainable development within planetary boundaries.  It highlights the urgency of transitioning to this model, citing alarming statistics on resource consumption, pollution, and climate change.\n",

LINEAR PRACTICES PREVAIL: OUR 8.6% CIRCULAR WORLD IS CONSUMING 100 BILLION TONNES OF RESOURCES A YEAR\n\nNearly all aspects of daily life are shaped by materials, and increasing activity leads to higher resource use.  Of the 100 billion tonnes of resources used annually, only 8.6% is cycled back into the economy.  The \"material x-ray\" visualizes the global material footprint behind societal needs and wants.  This chapter delves into the material x-ray and explains the decrease in global circularity from 9.1% to 8.6% in just two years.\n\nBetween the Paris Agreement and COP26, over half a trillion tonnes of virgin materials were consumed, and resource extraction is projected to almost double by 2050. Global material use has nearly quadrupled since 1970, outpacing population growth.  Over 90% of extracted materials become waste.  This rate of extraction threatens the planet's future.  The circular economy offers a framework for decoupling growth from material extraction.  The chapter details the massive flows of raw materials and products used and wasted in satisfying key societal needs (nutrition, mobility, housing, etc.).  It analyzes why global circularity has decreased, attributing it to extraction growth outpacing efficiency improvements and recycling capacity lagging behind consumption rates.  The limited capacity to cycle materials globally means continued reliance on virgin materials.  The chapter also examines how material consumption must be reduced to keep up with efficiency improvements and cycling advancements.  Significant materials are invested in long-term stock (buildings, infrastructure), making them unavailable for cycling until end-of-use.  The report emphasizes the need for circular design, production, maintenance, and reuse of these resources.\n\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "The world uses 100 billion tonnes of resources annually, with only 8.6% recycled (down from 9.1% two years prior).  Linear practices dominate, leading to massive waste (over 90% of extracted materials) and unsustainable resource extraction projected to double by 2050.  This is attributed to extraction growth outpacing recycling capacity and efficiency improvements.  The report advocates for a circular economy focusing on design, production, maintenance, and reuse to reduce material consumption and reliance on virgin resources.\n",

THE CIRCULARITY-CLIMATE LINK: ENACTED GLOBALLY, A CIRCULAR ECONOMY CAN HELP CLOSE THE EMISSIONS GAP\n\nThree Circularity Gap Reports focused on measuring global circularity and identifying levers for change. The 2021 report quantified how closing the Circularity Gap can also close the Emissions Gap.  Rising resource use contributes to billions of tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—70% of total emissions.  The report presents a roadmap of 21 circular solutions to transform material use and cut emissions.\n\nThe UN Environment Programme's Emissions Gap reports highlight the discrepancy between projected emissions and levels needed to limit global warming. This report defines the Emissions Gap in relation to a 1.5-degree trajectory by 2032.  It emphasizes that focusing solely on clean energy is insufficient to close the Emissions Gap.  The majority of GHG emissions (70%) stem from material handling and use.  Circular economy strategies, prioritizing material value retention and reduced consumption, are highly effective in cutting GHG emissions.  The analysis identifies mobility, housing, and nutrition as the most emissions-intensive societal needs, accounting for almost 70% of global emissions.  The report outlines scenarios and 21 circular solutions (see Figure 3) to address the emissions gap without relying on the clean energy transition. These solutions can reduce global material use and extraction by 28%, cut GHG emissions by 39%, and keep warming to 1.5 degrees.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "The Circularity Gap Reports demonstrate a strong link between circular economy practices and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  Focusing solely on clean energy is insufficient; 70% of emissions originate from material use.  The reports propose 21 circular solutions to reduce material use by 28%, cut emissions by 39%, and help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by addressing high-emission sectors like mobility, housing, and nutrition.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\n# 4. A CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR SOCIETY: CIRCULAR SOLUTIONS CAN HELP MOVE COUNTRIES TOWARD A SAFE AND JUST SPACE\n\nAddressing the climate emergency requires reducing inequalities and protecting planetary boundaries.  The 2020 report found that no country operates within an ecologically safe and socially just space.  The circular economy can bridge this gap, but tailored solutions are necessary for different contexts and populations.  The report highlights seven core societal needs (housing, nutrition, etc.) and emphasizes the need for resource-efficient and people-centric approaches.  It cautions against repeating the mistakes of the linear economy, which often exploited people and the planet.\n\nEthical considerations and potential trade-offs in the circular transition are addressed. The report categorizes countries into three profiles: Build, Grow, and Shift, based on their Human Development Index (HDI) and Ecological Footprint.  Build countries (e.g., India, Ethiopia) have low HDI rankings but operate within planetary boundaries.  Grow countries (e.g., China, Brazil) are rapidly industrializing, consuming significant resources and emitting high levels of GHGs.  Shift countries (e.g., European countries, the US) have high HDI scores but exceed planetary boundaries with excessive consumption.  No country has achieved an ecologically safe and socially just space. The report presents various initiatives to address this issue, including using traditional knowledge in Burkina Faso (roofing), addressing post-harvest losses in Nigeria (ColdHubs), mainstreaming sustainable practices in India (building regulations), and financing recycling infrastructure in the Ivory Coast.  In Grow countries, it highlights initiatives that address waste picking in Mexico, promote circular design in Brazil, and implement sustainable wastewater management in Bogotá.  Finally, it showcases car-centric urban design in Barcelona and urban agriculture in Rosario, Argentina.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "This report argues that a circular economy is crucial for achieving both social justice and environmental sustainability.  It finds no country currently operates within safe ecological and social limits.  The report categorizes countries (Build, Grow, Shift) based on their development and environmental impact, proposing tailored circular economy solutions for each.  Examples include promoting traditional knowledge, reducing food waste, improving recycling, and implementing sustainable urban design, demonstrating the diverse applications of a circular economy approach globally.\n",

THE WAY FORWARD: CREATING AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OF THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION\n\nCOP26's mixed outcomes highlight the need for urgent, large-scale change.  The report emphasizes three key pillars for the next five years: data-driven digital tools, metrics and measurement, and social considerations.  The world's circularity stands at only 8.6%, resulting in wastefulness, pollution, and carbon intensity.  The report underscores that focusing solely on renewable energy isn't enough; addressing resource use and consumption is crucial. A circular economy can significantly reduce GHG emissions and resource use, helping achieve the Paris Agreement's goals.\n\nThe report advocates for data-driven digital tools to improve knowledge sharing and innovation, enhanced data collection and collaboration between public and private sectors.  It stresses the importance of metrics to track progress and identify impactful avenues, enabling goal setting, peer review, and benchmarking.  Finally, it promotes a social lens to ensure a just and safe transition, supporting various SDGs, including ending hunger and providing decent work.  Government support for workforce training and using data to track circular job development are highlighted as crucial.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "To accelerate the circular economy transition in the next five years, the report advocates for: 1) leveraging data-driven digital tools to improve knowledge sharing and innovation; 2) implementing robust metrics and measurement systems to track progress and benchmark performance; and 3) prioritizing social considerations, ensuring a just transition that supports sustainable development goals, including job creation and workforce training.  This multifaceted approach is crucial because current circularity levels are low (8.6%), and addressing resource consumption is as vital as renewable energy transition for meeting climate goals.\n",
