We are currently overshooting five of the nine \nboundaries crucial to the health of our planet—continuing along \nthis path will mean putting people and planet increasingly in harm’s \nway. Through a circular economy, we can relieve these pressures, \nbringing humanity back within a safe operating space.\nCIRCLE ECONOMY\nWe are a global impact organisation with an \ninternational team of passionate experts based \nin Amsterdam.\nWe empower businesses, cities and nations \nwith practical and scalable solutions to put the \ncircular economy into action. Our vision is an \neconomic system that ensures the planet and all \npeople can thrive.\nTo avoid climate breakdown, our goal is to \ndouble global circularity by 2032.\n In collaboration with:\nWe are an international professional services \nnetwork comprising over 333,000 specialists \nwho provide audit and assurance, consulting, \nfinancial advisory, risk advisory, tax, and related \nservices to clients in over 150 countries. Our \npurpose is to make an impact that matters.\nTo build the sustainable future we need,  \nat the speed we need to build it, we have to work \ntogether in new, more ambitious and impactful \nways.  Our goal is to convene the private \nsector, public sector and society to inform and \nenable actionable strategies that will improve \ncircularity, in a way that benefits businesses, \nsociety, and the planet.\n\nIN SUPPORT OF THE\nCIRCULARITY GAP REPORT\nFRANS TIMMERMANS \nVice President at the  \nEuropean Commission\n‘Humanity has to learn to live within planetary \nboundaries. When we decouple economic growth from \nmaterial use, prevent and reduce waste, use recycled \nmaterials instead of primary raw materials and boost \ncircular business models, we can do it. By making our \neconomy fully circular, we create new jobs, accelerate \ninnovation, and at the same time fight the climate and \nbiodiversity crises. With the Green Deal, Europe is now \nleading the circularity transition. But we challenge \nothers to beat us: in the race to save the future of \nhumanity there can only be winners.

What is essential now? Further \ninterconnectivity between organisations, governments \nand societies to accelerate the impact we make.’\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n7\n6\n\n\nThe global economy is now only 7.2% circular; and \nit’s getting worse year on year—driven by rising \nmaterial extraction and use.  The global economy \nincreasingly relies on materials from virgin sources. In \nthe six years of the Circularity Gap Report , the global \neconomy extracted and used more than in the entire \n20th century 1—improving people’s living standards, \nbut at the same time breaking through the safe \nenvironmental limits of the planet. The first edition \nof our Report  in 2018 was the first ever to measure \nglobal circularity, finding it was 9.1%. It dropped to \n8.6% in 2020 and has now fallen to 7.2%. Comparing \nthese figures can be difficult, 2 however, we can assert \nthat circularity goes down as the general rate of global \nmaterial extraction rises. This is coupled with the fact \nthat more and more materials are going into stocks \nsuch as roads, homes and durable goods, thus leaving \nfewer materials to cycle back into the economy. A \ncircular economy focused on cycling alone cannot keep \nup with virgin material use rising to unprecedented \nheights—we cannot recycle our way out of this one.\nWith a circular economy, we can fulfil people’s \nneeds* with just 70% of the materials we currently \nuse—within the safe limits of the planet.  Our \ncurrent economic model is smashing through the \nplanet’s safe limits. Today, five of the nine key \n‘planetary boundaries’ that measure environmental \nhealth across land, sea and air have been broken—\nlargely due to the impacts of the linear ‘take-make-\nwaste’ economy. It is, therefore, critical that we \ntransform our relationship with materials to maximise \nbenefits for people and to minimise the pressure on \nthe planet’s life support systems. Essentially, this  \nstudy finds that adopting a circular economy could  \nnot only reverse the overshoot of planetary \nboundaries, but it could slash the global need for \nmaterial extraction by about one-third. This reduction \nis rooted in removing fossil fuels from the global \nequation—especially coal—and lowering demand for \nhigh volume minerals, such as sand and gravel, largely \nfor housing and infrastructure.\nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\nUse less, use longer, use again and make clean. \nThese four key circular economy principles underpin \nthe solutions presented in this report, highlighting \nhow there is much more to a circular economy than \njust recycling. The 16 circular solutions identified in \nthis report centre on principles that can lead to a \nsharp decline in virgin material extraction (use less) \nand to using the materials that we do have better and \nfor longer (use longer), as well as swapping out fossil \nfuels for renewable energy and toxic materials for \nregenerative ones (make clean). They also boost the \nuse of secondary materials (use again). The circular \neconomy as we present it aims to optimise how \nmaterials are used for the wellbeing of all. It focuses \non circular materials management and minimising \nconsumption towards sufficiency levels—where \nappropriate—to reduce environmental impact.\nCircular solutions for only four global systems \nwill address the lion’s share of environmental \npressures.  This report’s analysis considers the \nimpact of circular materials management on air and \nwater pollution, waste, nature degradation and loss, \nand more—basing our projections on the Planetary \nBoundaries framework. It finds that unleashing just \n16 transformational circular solutions across four \nkey systems—Food systems, the Built environment, \nManufactured goods and consumables, and Mobility \nand transport—can reverse the current overshoot \nof five of the nine key planetary boundaries, thereby \nmaintaining thriving ecosystems for water, land and \nair, and limiting the global temperature rise to within \n2-degrees. Our analysis is unconstrained from political, \neconomic and social dynamics: the findings, therefore, \nserve as an inspiration—providing us with a snapshot \nof what an alternative world could look like.\nEach country has a different starting point and will \nprogress at a different pace towards the shared \nglobal goal of reversing environmental overshoot, \nwhile fulfilling people’s needs. Bringing these \ncircular solutions to life requires an understanding of \nlocal, national and trading contexts. Transformational \nchange does not look the same across the world: \nsome countries need to radically reduce material \nextraction and use, while others need to stabilise or \neven grow it. This study considers these nuances. \nThe world’s highest-income (Shift)  countries deliver \nhigh standards of living, but consume the majority of \nthe world’s materials and massively overshoot many \nplanetary boundaries. These countries must focus on \nreducing overconsumption and lightening their impact \non the environment. Middle-income (Grow) countries \nare rapidly industrialising and have a growing middle \nclass—their material consumption has increased in \ntandem but some are now reaching saturation points. \nThese countries should now focus on new ways to \nstabilise and optimise their material consumption to \nmaximise societal wellbeing. Finally, Build countries \nhouse the majority of the world’s population but use \nless than a tenth of the materials of Shift  countries. \nThese countries should focus on the building up of \ninfrastructure and the provision of wellbeing, even if \nthis requires that they increase their material footprint.\nTo reverse the overshoot and achieve wellbeing \nwithin safe limits, purpose-driven collaboration \nbetween the public and private sectors is \nessential—only then can we scale the transition  \nto a circular economy.  Chapter five highlights the \ncrucial role of public-private collaboration in achieving \nthis bold vision for the future. Circular business models \ncan deliver huge material savings, such as Mobility-as-\na-Service for material-intensive cars that sit unused \nfor 95% of their lifetimes in the Shift  countries. Policy \ncan greatly magnify such business efforts and manage \npotential rebound effects by setting ambitious targets \nfor active mobility in cities, and mandating Extended \nProducer Responsibility. Policy is also crucial to enable \na just transition to a circular economy. There will \ncertainly be several big shifts from linear to circular \nindustries, and potentially rebound effects from \nincreased material efficiency, but policy makers can \nuphold the importance of wellbeing for its citizens  \nand workers. The shift from linear to circular industries \nwill see a seismic shift from business-as-usual, leading \nto rebound effects resulting from increased material \nefficiency. This is why policy makers are essential \nchangemakers in upholding the rights of citizens  \nand workers in the transition. Policy, along with  \nthe entire economic system, needs to shed business-\nas-usual: embracing long-term vision and interests \nover short-term rewards.\nA circular economy offers solutions on how to \nreduce, regenerate and redistribute vital materials \nuse, for both the planet and all its living beings.  \nIn order to achieve the bold ambitions of a circular \neconomy as laid out in this report, we need a shared \nvision. The following three principles can help bring a \nshared focus to business leaders and policy makers:\n• Reduce: from efficiency to sufficiency, \nresilience and adaptiveness.  The economy is \nembedded in nature and nature has limits. We \nmust, therefore, also place boundaries on material \nuse and prioritise the transformation of material \nuse into societal benefits. This means a circular \neconomy must push for a cultural shift to prioritise \nimmaterial ways to fulfil needs, and invest in \nhealth, wellbeing and education and decent jobs, \nrather than material accumulation—as does the \npredominant economic model in many parts  \nof the world.\n• Regenerate: from extraction to regeneration. \nAbout one-quarter of all materials consumed \nby the global economy every year come from \nregenerative sources. The regenerative capacity \nof the planet is a gift—so we must respect and \nsupport its capacity to regenerate, also for future \ngenerations. Many regenerative solutions already \nexist today that show that we can move from \nhumanity being net-negative to net-positive on \nEarth’s life support system. \n• Redistribute: from accumulation to \ndistribution. There is currently enough wealth \nand materials in the world to provide a good \nquality of life to every single human being on \nthis planet. 3 The challenge is ensuring that \nwe can distribute the access to materials to \nan increasingly expanding group of people, \nrequiring redistribution, different lifestyles, better \ntechnologies and social innovations. 4 By moving \naway from ownership and accumulation and \ntowards models of access that distribute resources \nmore equally, we can move towards a system that \nprovides high standards of living to all.\n*The Circularity Gap Report  typically bases its analysis on seven key ‘societal \nneeds and wants’, recognising that materials are increasingly used to fulfil \nmany non-essential ‘wants’. Our analysis does not fully deliberate the \nthreshold point at which a ‘need’ becomes a ’want across all needs and wants.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n9\n8\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n1\nINTRODUCTION\n12 – 15\n2\nTHE CURRENT STATE OF \nTHE WORLD\nCircularity on a growing planet\n16 – 25\n3\nREVERSING THE \nOVERSHOOT\nLiving within the safe limits of the \nplanet\n26 – 39\n4\nDIFFERENT COUNTRIES, \nDIFFERENT CIRCULAR \nSOLUTIONS\nTailored circular pathways\n40 – 55\n5\nTAKE ACTION\nNext steps for businesses, cities and \ncountries\n56 – 59\nCONTENTS\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n11\n\n\nINTRO-\nDUCTION\n1\nThe year that has elapsed between the Circularity \nGap Report 2022 ’s publication and this one has \nbeen like no other. Many have suffered through \nthe impacts of a global pandemic, droughts, \nwildfires, geopolitical instability and more. Not \none continent was untouched by the dangerous \nimpacts of climate breakdown. The issues that \nwe must collaborate on to solve have long been \nknown—poverty, unsustainable lifestyles, an \neconomic system that prioritises GDP over human \nand planetary wellbeing and more—and the \nurgency is building. Life shouldn’t be determined \nby the cards that you were dealt, but by how you \nplay your hand. Our systems have been wildly \ndegenerative for the past centuries, but why \nshould they continue to be? This report lays out \nsome hard truths about how our linear economic \nmodel has pushed a range of planetary boundaries \nto dangerous and unpredictable limits. But it also \npresents solutions: showing how people’s needs \nand wants—such as nutrition, mobility, housing, \nand basic goods—can be satisfied within crucial \nplanetary boundaries. The key to these solutions \nis circular principles: some so simple that you’d \nwonder why we haven’t always done things this \nway. Others will require radical collaboration \nbetween a variety of actors from industry and \ngovernment and a radical shift in the lifestyles of \nthe world’s wealthiest. But all should inspire us to \ncreate an economy that emulates nature: naturally \ncircular and supporting life. We have a strong hand.\nMATERIALS ARE CENTRAL TO THE STORY \nOF HUMAN PROSPERITY\nMaterials have long propelled human affluence, driving \nrising living standards over the past (at least) 100 \nyears, enhancing life expectancy and employment, \nas well as basic education levels. However, this \nprogress has also come at a tremendous cost: the \nmodern industrial economy is inherently linear—\ncharacterised by ‘take-make-waste’ processes in \npractice. It is also powered by fossil fuels, a finite and \npolluting energy source. Meanwhile, injustice has also \nbecome central to the story of the global economy’s \nrelationship with materials: in many parts of the world, \noverconsumption has effectively become the norm,  \nwhilst elsewhere, minimum living standards are  \nnot even met.\nYET THE LINEAR ECONOMY HAS EXCEEDED \nTHE SAFE AND HEALTHY LIMITS OF THE \nPLANET\nMuch of the environmental impact that has occurred \nin the past 100 years can be attributed to rising \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—and our Circularity \nGap Report 2021 found that 70% of global GHG \nemissions are tied to material handling and use.\n5 \nBut the impacts go far beyond emissions. Ultimately, \nmaterial extraction and use is a strong proxy for \nenvironmental damage\n6—driving over 90% of total \nglobal biodiversity loss and water stress, for example. 7 \nIn fulfilling societal needs—and many wants—we are \nnow transgressing five of nine planetary boundaries \nthat are crucial to planetary health: climate change, \nbiodiversity loss, land system change, chemical \npollution, and cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus. \nOcean acidification—also driven by spiralling carbon \nemissions—is dangerously close to its tipping point. \nClearly, our relationship with materials requires \nbalance. The pursuit of a circular economy—a means \nto the end goal of relieving environmental pressures \nand shaping a thriving society for people—requires \nmore efficient, and sometimes less, material use. Now, \nwe’re consuming and wasting too much, dragging \ndown our global circularity.\nRISING MATERIAL USE DOES DRIVE BETTER \nGLOBAL LIVING STANDARDS—BUT ONLY UP \nTO A POINT\nWhile instrumental to raising living standards, \nresearch shows that after a certain level of material \nconsumption, wellbeing ceases to increase.\n8 9 And \nwe cannot fully blame rising material use on the \nballooning population: in the past 50 years, the global \npopulation has doubled, yet material extraction has \nmore than tripled. Ultimately, the bulk of this has been \nlargely concentrated in wealthy countries (especially \nin a few hotspots, such as North America and Europe), \nand we now see material extraction rising in rapidly \ngrowing middle-income nations ( Grow countries)—\nChina, for example, is thought to be responsible for \n75% of the growth in material consumption since the \nyear 2000.\n10 Affluence, overconsumption and waste \nare the real accelerators of global material demand. \nAnd such affluence has been unequally distributed \nfor far too long: over the past 40 years, for example, \nmore than one-quarter of the new income from global \nGDP growth has gone straight to the world’s richest \nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n13\n12\n\n1%.11 12 Similarly, just eight nations (France, Germany, \nItaly, Japan, the UK, the US, Canada and Russia) \nwere responsible for 85% of GHG emissions in 2015, \nwhile many Build  nations still live within planetary \nboundaries. The question of how richer nations—\nwhich have largely been responsible for climate-related \ndisasters—can help poorer, more vulnerable nations \nwas front and centre at COP27 in November 2022.\nIS A NEW BLUEPRINT FOR A SUSTAINABLE \nFUTURE FINALLY EMERGING?\nMuch of the world’s coordinated climate action has \nfocused on GHG emission reduction: 196 countries \nsigned the Paris Agreement in 2015, committing \nto limiting average global temperature rise to \n1.5-degrees. However, we’re slowly beginning to see \naction that extends beyond decarbonisation: China’s \nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the \nParis Agreement, for example, details plans to build \nup recycling infrastructure, scale eco-industrial parks \nand ramp up the reuse of organic waste,\n13 while the \nJapanese Government has bold aims to reach ‘full \ncircularity’ by 2050—with a focus on regenerative \nbusiness that helps—rather than hurts—nature.\n14 \nMany other governments have also zoomed in to \nthe local level, co-developing policy roadmaps for \ncircular cities that centre on reducing soaring material \ndemand by better-managing urban spaces and rolling \nout green active transport options—strategies that \nalso tend to improve wellbeing.\n15 As circular solutions \ncontinue to make their way into climate targets around \nthe world, it’s crucial that holistic measures that \nsystemically cut consumption and extend materials’ \nvalue take centre stage along with cycling efforts. \nMeanwhile, transforming economic systems to \nembrace circularity and low-carbon systems will lead \nto job gains as well as losses—as fossil fuels plants are \ndecommissioned in favour of solar and wind farms, for \nexample. Fortunately, research and policy increasingly \nanticipates and addresses the future negative impacts \non workers, industries and regions. Indeed, support \nmeasures, such as reskilling programmes for workers, \nand economic diversification policies for regions, are \ncrucial to a just transition.\nInteresting debates targeting the heart of dominant \nglobal economics have also reached new heights \nthis year: growth at all costs versus green growth \nor degrowth, for example. Meanwhile, countries \nare experimenting with and sharing knowledge \non innovative policy approaches for ‘wellbeing \neconomies’—the Wellbeing Economy Governments \npartnership (WEGo), for example, currently comprises \nNew Zealand, Scotland, Iceland, Wales and Finland.\n16 \nIceland has a range of indicators for wellbeing that \nguide its government in decision making, for example. \nFurthermore, the concept of the Doughnut Economy\n17 \nis being explored in cities such as Amsterdam, \nBrussels, Melbourne, Berlin and Sydney,\n18 and even \nin industries such as the British fashion industry. 19 \nBased on a combination of the Planetary Boundaries \nframework and the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals, the Doughnut aims to reprioritise traditional \neconomics towards the goal of ensuring the needs \nof all are met within the means of the planet. This \ngoal is aligned with a circular economy: one that \nis regenerative by design and retains materials’ \nmaximum value in society for as long as possible.\nA CIRCULAR ECONOMY—IN ITS FULL \nBREADTH—IS THE FOUNDATION FOR A \nMORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\nCurrent trends are alarming: over the last 30 years, \nwe’ve lost an area close to the size of Iraq (420 million \nhectares) to deforestation.\n20 Close to half of the Earth’s \nsoil is seriously degraded, roughly 85% of global fish \nstocks are facing collapse, and wildlife populations \nhave plunged by 70%\n21 in the last half-century. It’s  \nhigh time to turn the tide. Adopting circular solutions \nacross key systems could fulfil our needs with just \n70% of the materials we currently use—and crucially, \ncould bring the vital signs of the planet back within \nsafe limits. A circular economy does this by prioritising \nsystemic solutions that help us use less, use longer, \nuse again and make clean. A circular economy has a \nkey role in striking a safe and fair balance between \nhuman life and ecological limits: the ultimate goal of \nthe 21st century.\nThis report will allow you—as a policy maker or a \nbusiness leader—to embrace systems thinking: \nrethinking the entire system and understanding that \none small change in a single place can impact the \nwhole. We must think along with the planet and draw \ninspiration from nature to create a more balanced \nworld: reduce, regenerate and redistribute. \nWe have a strong hand—let’s play our cards right.\nAIMS OF THE CIRCULARITY GAP \nREPORT 2023 :\n1. Quantify  the current circular state of \nthe world: update the Circularity Metric \nand a range of other crucial indicators \nconcerning global material flows.\n2. Identify  key circular solutions within \nkey systems that are based on the needs \nof society and impactful on a range of \nplanetary boundaries for healthy air, water \nand land.\n3. Demonstrate  the power that these \ncircular economy solutions can have \nin reversing the overshoot on multiple \nplanetary boundaries. \n4. Illustrate  which circular solutions are \nmost suitable for different country \nprofiles, based on economic, social and \nenvironmental differences, in order for \nthem to reach their goals. \nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n15\n14\n\n\nCURRENT\nTHE\nSTATE OF THE\nWORLD\n2\nCIRCULARITY\nON  A \nGROWING \nPLANET\nThe planet is now home to 8 billion people—and \nin sheltering, feeding, transporting and clothing \nthese billions, the global economy consumes a \nlandmark 100 billion tonnes of materials per year. \nBy 2050 material extraction and use is expected to \ndouble relative to 2015 levels, threatening a total \nbreakdown of Earth’s life support systems, which \nare already at a breaking point.\n22 Without material \nmanagement strategies that keep us within \nplanetary boundaries, the UN has warned of ‘total \nsocietal collapse’, driven by concurrent climate \nchange disasters, economic vulnerabilities, political \ninstabilities and ecosystem failures.\n23 A crucial \nsolution to address this challenge is a circular \neconomy: more than just recycling, increases in \nsecondary material use must be matched by a \nsystemic approach to smart material management \nthat enables doing more with less, using for \nlonger and substituting with sustainably managed \nregenerative materials. By upgrading to a model \nthat maximises the value that we extract from \nour precious materials, we can better ensure the \nwellbeing of present and future generations, while \nrespecting the boundaries of our planet.\nTHE CURRENT STATE OF CIRCULARITY  \nWorldwide, total material extraction is on the rise: it \nmore than tripled since 1970, but almost doubled since \nthe year 2000—reaching 100 billion tonnes today. \nThis growth is not solely due to the global population \ndoubling since 1970, as per-person material use has \nonly increased by a factor of 1.7. For instance, while \nvirgin material demand in 1970 was around 7.4 tonnes \nper person, far below today’s approximately 12 \ntonnes,\n24 this growth in per-person material demand \nhas not been evenly distributed across countries. \nMaterial use may outpace population growth in high-\nincome countries, while the opposite is true for lower-\nincome countries—generating a global average that \ndoesn’t show the full picture. Ultimately, the metabolic \nrate of the global economy is accelerating: material \nextraction and consumption are growing at almost \nunprecedented rates, comparable to the  \n‘Great Acceleration’ occuring in the period after the \nSecond World War.\n25 This is revealed by the fact that \nvirgin material use is not set to slow down anytime \nsoon: without urgent action, it is expected to reach  \n190 billion tonnes by 2060.\n26\nHow can a circular economy change this picture? We \nmeasure circularity by looking at what is flowing into \nthe economy. Today, the global economy consumes \n100 billion tonnes of materials, and a portion of that \nconsumption every year comes from secondary \nmaterials. The Circularity Metric, introduced in 2018, \nwas the first approximation of how ‘circular’ the global \neconomy was. In this year’s edition of the Circularity \nGap Report , we present a more holistic view on the \ncircularity of the economy, by looking deeper into the \nlinear consumption that makes up the ‘Circularity Gap’.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n17\n16\n\nCIRCULAR INPUTS\nSecondary materials that are cycled back into the \nglobal economy, otherwise known as circular inputs, \naccount for 7.2%  of all material inputs into the \neconomy—this is the Circularity Metric.\nCircular inputs measure the share of \nsecondary materials that are cycled back \ninto the economy from waste. In just the \npast five years, the world’s circularity has \nshrunk from 9.1% to 7.2% of total material \ninputs. This isn’t simply because we’re failing \nto cycle more—it’s also due to increasing \nvirgin extraction and the fact that we are \nputting more and more materials into stocks \nlike roads, homes and durable goods. This \nmeans that the global economy cannot cycle \nenough to create a truly closed-loop of \nconsumption: without significantly reducing \nmaterial use, it’s inevitable that the \nCircularity Metric will continue to fall.\nRENEWABLE INPUTS  \nThe potential share of renewable materials put into the \neconomy are measured as renewable inputs. These are \ndivided into Ecological cycling potential  (21.2%) —carbon \nneutral biomass—and Non-renewable biomass  (3.8%) —\nbiomass that is not carbon neutral. Together, these \nrepresent approximately 25% of all material inputs.\nBiomass  use has grown by a factor of 2.7 in \nthe past fifty years, now representing about \n27% of total material consumption today, or \n25 billion tonnes per year. Biomass includes \neverything that is harvested from the \nground—from food and feed crops, to \nnatural fibres and timber products. While \nbiomass is largely considered renewable, \nsome is considered non-renewable due to \nthe imbalance in the carbon cycle.\n27 The \nways in which biomass is cultivated is \nprecarious, with land system change often \nlinked to deforestation, soil depletion and \nthe draining of wetlands, which have all \nserved to damage biodiversity while \ndamaging carbon sinks—the latter also \ncausing an increase in emissions.\nWhile carbon neutrality is a necessary condition \nfor biomass to be considered sustainable, it is not \nsufficient in itself: other nutrients such as nitrogen \nand phosphorus should be fully circulated back \ninto the economy or the environment as well. As of \nyet, methodological limitations exist in determining \nnutrient cycling. To this end, in line with past Circularity \nGap Reports , we have excluded ecological cycling in \nour calculation of the global Circularity Metric. For \nexample, we cannot track biomass to its final end-of-\nlife stage, so it isn’t easy to ensure that the nutrient \ncycle has closed. If this were the case, however—and if \nsustainable biomass management were to become the \nnorm—circularity could significantly increase.\nNON-RENEWABLE INPUTS  \nThese materials represent about 15% of total inputs to \nthe global economy and are composed of metals and \nnon-metallic minerals.\nMetal ores  have increased by more than 3.5 \ntimes in fifty years, to 9.4 billion tonnes, \nwhile still representing just one-tenth of \ntotal extraction. This relatively sharp \nincrease is due to the expansion of the built \nenvironment and manufacturing sectors, as \nwell as the transition to clean energy—a \nnecessary but material-intensive process, \nparticularly for metals. The mining of \nmetals, as well as non-metallic minerals, \nhas spurred biodiversity loss, in addition \nto pollution of water, air and soil, and toxic \nwaste generation.\nNon-metallic minerals  have seen the \nsteepest growth: their extraction has \nincreased nearly five times over the last  \n50 years, and now represents almost half  \nof total material extraction, at 42.8 billion \ntonnes. This is primarily due to a booming \nconstruction industry and the need to \nhouse, provide infrastructure and cater  \nfor rising populations in many parts of  \nthe world.\nNON-CIRCULAR INPUTS\nReferring exclusively to fossil fuel energy carriers, \nthese materials represent 14.6%  of total inputs in the \nglobal economy. \nFossil fuels  used for energy consumption \nare highly impactful from an environmental \nperspective and inherently non-circular—\nwhen combusted—as they result in \ndispersed emissions in the atmosphere. \nFossil fuel consumption has grown about 2.6 \ntimes over the last 50 years—and \nrepresents a substantially smaller share of \nthe total: we now consume about 15.5 billion \ntonnes of these materials per year. This is \nlikely due to fossil fuels’ lighter weight \ncompared to heavy materials like minerals. \nHowever, they’re certainly not without \nimpact: the global economy has scaled up \ntheir use to, for example, build and power \nbuildings and industries, transport people \nand goods around the world, produce \nsynthetic fertilisers and manufacture a \nwhole host of basic goods—leading to \nsoaring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nand driving climate change, among other \nenvironmental issues.\nSTOCK BUILD UP\nRepresenting a massive 38% of total material input \ninto the global economy, stock build up is composed of \ncircular, non-renewable and renewable materials—as \ndescribed above—most notably non-metallic minerals \nin the form of construction materials, such as concrete \ngoing into buildings, as well as metal ores such as steel, \naluminium and copper going mainly into buildings, \ninfrastructure, and machinery.\nStocks have grown 23-fold in the 21st \ncentury. This has mainly been in the form of \nlarge, long-lasting structures such as \nbuildings, infrastructure and roads (these \naccount for the largest portion of materials), \nas well as vehicles, machinery, and the \nequipment and appliances we use day-to-\nday. In 2018, approximately 43.6 billion \ntonnes of materials were added to stocks, \nwhile almost 12 billion tonnes were depleted \nfrom stocks in the form of end-of-life waste. \nNet additions to stock thus amounted to \n38.2 billion tonnes. As global material \nextraction and use has surged, a clear \npattern has emerged: almost two-thirds of \nnet stock addition occurs in Grow countries \n(see country profile descriptions on page \n42), while Build  countries contribute to  \nfewer than one-tenth (9%) of total global \nstock additions.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n19\n18\n\n\nOPENING UP \nTHE GAP\nFigure one illustrates how key materials flow into different parts of the economy—\nincluding additions to stock and waste—and highlights where circular strategies \n(narrow, slow, regenerate and cycle) may be most appropriate. \n*Emissions include dissipated materials\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n21\n20\n\n\nTHE KEY LEVERS TO \nTRANSITION TOWARDS \nA CIRCULAR ECONOMY\nNow that we have explored the different types of materials that enter the economy every year, we can \nbegin to see where the different principles of circular economy can be applied in our socioeconomic \nmetabolism: we can design stocks  like buildings, infrastructure, machinery and vehicles to be rich \nresource mines for the future, and design manufactured goods and consumables to be cycled  and \nmade regenerative . Furthermore, the focus must also centre on getting more value out of fewer \nmaterials. Achieving the aims of a circular economy—minimising material use, regenerating the  \nEarth and preventing material losses—can be done through four key strategies, based on the work  \nof Bocken et al. (2016):\n1.  NARROW: USE LESS\nNarrow strategies reduce material and energy use. Currently, material use is highly inefficient and \nineffective; we can deliver similar social outcomes by using much less and phasing out fossil fuels, for \nexample. This doesn’t mean being worse off, but rather focussing on using materials efficiently: think \nin terms of riding a bike instead of driving a car, eating less meat and living in a space that suits your \nneeds. Using less is a core tenet of the circular economy—yet currently, the threshold for sustainable \nconsumption, 8 tonnes per person,\n28 is being surpassed by 1.5 times.\n2.  SLOW: USE LONGER\nSlow strategies aim to keep materials in use for as long as possible, for example through design for \ndurability and repairability. A more circular economy is also a slower one: materials, components and \nproducts—and even buildings and infrastructure—that we lock in stocks  are made to last. This will \nlower material demand in the long run, in essence also serving to narrow resource flows.\n3.  REGENERATE: MAKE CLEAN\nRegenerate strategies phase out hazardous or toxic materials and processes, and substitute them \nwith regenerative biomass resources. A circular economy aims to mimic natural cycles—by shifting \nto more regenerative farming practices, for example—while also maximising the share of circular \nbiomass that enters the economy.\n29 Regeneration can happen both at the systems level (by designing \nregenerative processes) as well as at the product level (by switching synthetic to organic fertilisers, \nfor example).\n4.  CYCLE: USE AGAIN\nCycle strategies aim to cycle and reuse materials at their highest value: they maximise the volume \nof secondary materials re-entering the economy, ultimately minimising the need for virgin material \ninputs and therefore also narrowing  flows. Of course, virgin materials will always be needed to a \ndegree: all materials degrade and can’t be cycled infinitely, use energy, and require blending with \nvirgin materials to maintain strength and functionality. \nPRODUCT\nDESIGN\nFUNCTIONAL\nUSE END/hyphen.caseOF/hyphen.caseLIFE\nNARROW\nUSE LESS\nREGENERATE\nMAKE CLEAN\nCYCLE\nUSE AGAIN\nSLOW\nUSE LONGER\nFigure two depicts the four flows to achieve circular objectives: narrow, slow, \nregenerate and cycle.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n23\n22\n\nPRACTICAL CHALLENGES\nIN QUANTIFYING CIRCULARITY\nMeasuring a baseline for global circularity \noffers many advantages, not least that it can \nbe used as a compelling call to action. After \nall, the figures are clear—circularity is in \nreverse. The circular economy, however, is an \nintricate and holistic concept, and representing \nit through one single Metric requires certain \nsimplifications. The limitations stemming from \nthese simplifications are:\nTHERE IS MORE TO CIRCULARITY THAN \n(MASS-BASED) CYCLING\nThe circular economy has multiple aims: keeping \nmaterials in use, at the highest value possible, \nwhile decreasing material extraction and use. Our \nCircularity Metric only measures the mass-based \ncycling of materials that re-enter the economy and \ndoes not consider their composition, value or level \nof quality. Slow  strategies—making things last—and \nnarrow strategies—using less—also aren’t fully \ncaptured. While the introduction of the full Indicator \nFramework (see pages 18–19) is a solid starting \npoint for measuring elements of circularity beyond \ncycling, such as performance in material use, at \nleast for the baseline assessment—the inclusion \nof Net additions to stock is a first step towards \ncapturing slow strategies, for example—there are \nstill limitations. For instance, due to methodological \nchallenges as well as a lack of standardised \nmetrics and data gaps, reflecting such changes \nis not entirely possible—in spite of these loops \nbeing absolutely crucial for obtaining a rounded \nunderstanding of the circular economy.\nACHIEVING 100% CIRCULARITY IS NOT \nFEASIBLE\nWhile our objective may seem to be reaching a ‘fully \ncircular’ economy, this is technically not possible: \nthere’s a practical limit to the volume of materials \nthat can be recirculated. This is partially due to \ntechnical constraints, but also because some \nmaterials are combusted through their use (think \nfossil fuels) while others are locked into long-term \nstocks for many years, making them unavailable for \ncycling. What’s more: materials that can be cycled, \nsuch as metal, plastic and glass, may only be cycled \na few times, as each cycle degrades quality and will \nrequire at least some virgin inputs. The sheer volume \nof materials we use also poses a challenge: it would \ntake a very slow economy to downsize our material \nuse to match our capacity for recycling.\n30 There are \nalso trade-offs to consider: fossil fuels have no place \nin a circular economy, for example, yet the energy \ntransition will be highly material-intensive. In essence, \ndecarbonising the world will cause material extraction \nand consumption to spike—a phenomenon that will \ninevitably drag down the Metric. Our model, which \nanalyses the rate at which circularity could grow, makes \nestimates based on one snapshot in time, rather than a \ndynamic analysis of these future trade-offs.\nA CIRCULAR ECONOMY ISN’T SOCIALLY \nJUST BY DEFAULT\nEnsuring that the circular transition forges a safe space \nin which all people can thrive will require a systems \nredesign: in essence, we need to ensure that we \nminimise the resource use associated with meeting \nhuman needs. Circular strategies can help us achieve \nthis, but the social lens must be taken into account: \ncurrent understandings of the circular economy focus \non material use and do not consider issues of global \nsocial equity, and are threatening to exacerbate the \ndivide between high- and lower-income countries,\n31 as \nwell as within countries. National and supranational \npolicies and commitments in higher-income countries \ncan be short-sighted in practice: often formed to reach \nlocal targets, with no thought of the adverse impact \nthey may have beyond borders, which can include \nexacerbating global power imbalances in lower-income \ncountries, such as exploitative labour practices.\n32\n24\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n25\n\nREVERSING \nTHE\nOVER-\nSHOOT\n3\nLIVING WITHIN\nTHE SAFE LIMITS\nOF THE PLANET\nThe challenge of the 21st century must be to \nregain balance between satisfying people’s \nneeds and planetary health. Excessive and \nwasteful consumption is outdated—the planet \nis humanity’s life support system and it should \nbe treated as such. The circular economy offers a \ndeep pool of solutions that are key to solving this \nchallenge—using fewer materials where possible \nand squeezing out as much value as possible from \nthe materials we use. Achieving more with less. To \nachieve this, we have developed a series of global \nscenarios that model impacts against the Planetary \nBoundaries framework.\n33 This chapter displays the \nresults of this comprehensive approach: a global \ncircular economy that can reverse the overshoot, \nregenerate systems and achieve wellbeing for \npeople within planetary boundaries. The scenarios \nthat we have developed are designed to explore \nthe ‘what if?’ and provide a glimpse into a world \nwhere we do things differently.\n34 Read on for the \nguide, split between four key systems, based \non the societal needs for housing, nutrition, the \nmanufacturing of basic goods, and mobility.\nMAPPING PLANETARY HEALTH: A COMPLEX \nAND INTERRELATED PICTURE\nThis analysis relies on the Planetary Boundaries \nframework to provide a holistic and in-depth \nunderstanding of planetary health. The framework was \nconceived in 2009 by Johan Rockström, former director \nof the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm \nUniversity, together with 28 world-renowned scientists, \nto identify the processes that regulate the stability and \nresilience of the Earth’s systems. They proposed nine \nquantifiable and interrelated planetary boundaries \nwithin which humanity can safely continue to thrive: \ncrossing these boundaries increases the risk of causing \nirreversible environmental changes, threatening \nhuman life on Earth.\n35 Today, five of the nine planetary \nboundaries have been crossed, 36 and we are now \nfunctioning beyond a sustainable operating space \nand are in the ‘danger zone’ of irreversible change to \nEarth’s natural life-supporting system.\n37\nAN APPROACH BASED ON PEOPLE’S \nNEEDS—AND SOME WANTS\nCertain actions of the linear economy, from its \nthrowaway culture to its heavy use of fossil fuels, lead \nto huge rises in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \ncontributing to climate change. But ‘climate change’ is \nonly one of the nine boundaries. These boundaries laid \nout in the framework indicate different—but inherently \ninterrelated—components of planetary health\n48 that \ncurrent human activities cross in many different \nways (see page 29). If managed correctly, the circular \neconomy is a means to address the root causes of \neach of the planetary boundaries—truly allowing this \ngeneration to reverse the overshoot era. But how?\nOur Circularity Gap Reports have always grounded \ntheir perspectives through the seven societal \nneeds and wants: materials have a vital role to play \nin fulfilling people’s needs for housing, nutrition, \nmobility, manufacturing, healthcare, education and \ncommunication. A circular economy approach allows \nus to change the way we meet these needs. Consider \nthe need for mobility, which transports people \nfrom their homes to workplaces, friends and family. \nPrivate passenger vehicles require large volumes of \nmaterials and fuel to operate, spend nearly 95% of \ntheir lifetime parked and place heavy demands on \nroad infrastructure—and yet often only carry one \nor two people at a time.\n49 Taking a more circular \napproach, where public transport, car sharing and \nmore active modes like cycling are prioritised, can \ndramatically reduce both material use and pressure on \ninfrastructure. In essence: serving the same need, but \nwith far less impact.\nThis report examines how four of these key needs \nand wants—nutrition, housing, mobility and \nmanufacturing—connect to the Planetary Boundaries \nframework, finding that they contribute to the vast \nmajority of overshoot. In these areas of the economy, \nfeedback loops run wild: consider agriculture, for \nexample, where excessive fertiliser use intended to \nmaximise output harms soil health and biodiversity, \nwhich cuts yields, pushing us into even higher fertiliser \nuse. Through circular strategies, we can reverse this: If \nwe fundamentally reshape how we provide for needs \nby using less, using longer, using again and making \nclean, we can shrink our impact and land firmly back in \na safe operating space.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n27\n26\n\nSTAYING WITHIN THE SAFE LIMITS OF THE \nPLANET\nOur analysis explores how the global economy can \nmeet people’s needs for nutrition, housing, mobility, \nand manfuactured goods following circular economy \nprinciples. The result? A set of 16 circular solutions \nhave been modelled across four global systems:  \nFood systems, the Built environment, Manufactured \ngoods and consumables, and Mobility and transport. \nThe counterfactual scenarios that have been \ndeveloped in this report are designed to explore \n‘what if?’ and do not take into account the effects of \ntransitions over time, such as the changes in resource \nextraction in the transition to renewable energy.  \nEach of the solutions that have been modelled  \nare summarised on pages 33, 35, 37 and 39. \nFOOD SYSTEM\nThe full set of farm-to-fork-to-bin activities \nalong the agrifood value chain, involving \nthe production, processing, transport, \nconsumption and disposal of food.\n50 51 We \ndo not consider activities upstream from \nagriculture, such as fertiliser or machinery \nproduction for farms.\nMANUFACTURED GOODS AND \nCONSUMABLES\nA collection of production and consumption \nactivities related to durable manufactured \ngoods (such as machinery, equipment, \nvehicles and furniture) as well as \nconsumables (such as textiles, fast-moving \nconsumer goods and electronics). \nFor a more detailed description of the entire modelling \nexercise, please refer to the methodology document \naccompanying this report.*\nThe circular economy solutions belonging to each \nsystem typically only contribute a minor impact \nreduction across the planetary boundaries. But when \nwe combine them, we can see the substantial impact \nthat a circular economy can have at a global level.\n*Find the full methodology document at  \ncircularity-gap.world/methodology\nFreshwater consumption\nThis is measured in terms of ‘blue’ and ‘green’ water. \nBlue water is the freshwater held in surface reservoirs. \nGreen water is the fraction of rainfall that is absorbed \nby soil to feed plants. The freshwater cycle is closely \nlinked to climate change and its boundary mirrors that \nof the climate boundary. A water boundary related \nto consumptive freshwater use and environmental \nflow requirements has been proposed to maintain the \noverall resilience of the Earth system.\n44\nLand system change\nThis is driven primarily by agricultural expansion \nand intensification. Humanity may be reaching a \npoint where further agricultural land expansion at \na global scale may seriously threaten biodiversity \nand undermine the regulatory capacities of the \nEarth system. The Planetary Boundaries framework \nproposes that no more than 15% of global usable land \nshould be converted to cropland.\n45\nBiogeochemical flows: cycles of nitrogen and \nphosphorus\nNitrogen and phosphorus are both essential elements \nfor plant growth, but activities like agriculture, poor \nwastewater management and fossil fuel use convert \nmore atmospheric nitrogen into reactive forms than  \nall of the Earth’s terrestrial processes combined.  \nA significant fraction of these nutrients make their  \nway to the sea, and can push marine and aquatic \nsystems across ecological thresholds of their own,\n46 \nwhile impacting human health.\nAtmospheric aerosol loading\nThis is impacted by GHG emissions and land-use \nchange that releases dust and smoke into the air.  \nShifts in climate patterns and monsoon systems  \nhave already been seen in highly polluted \nenvironments, giving a quantifiable regional  \nmeasure for an aerosol boundary.\n47\nStratospheric ozone depletion\nThis means higher levels of UV radiation reach ground \nlevel. The appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole was \nproof that increased levels of man-made ozone-depleting \nchemical substances, interacting with polar stratospheric \nclouds, had passed a threshold. Fortunately, because \nof the actions taken as a result of the 1989 Montreal \nProtocol, we appear to be back on track to staying within \nthis boundary.\n38\nBiodiversity loss\nLoss of biosphere integrity results in the loss of local \nand regional biodiversity, which makes ecosystems \nmore vulnerable to changes in climate and ocean acidity. \nCurrently, the extinction rate is used as a boundary \nmeasure for loss of biosphere integrity. Today, the global \nextinction rate far exceeds the rate of speciation.\n39 If the \ncurrent extinction rate is sustained, an undesired system \nchange is highly likely.\nChemical pollution and release of novel \nentities\nThis includes microplastics, pesticides, heavy metal \ncompounds and radioactive materials. Persistent organic \npollution, for example, has caused dramatic reductions \nin bird populations and impaired reproduction and \ndevelopment in marine mammals.\n40\nClimate change\nThis is measured by CO 2 concentration in the \natmosphere, with a suggested boundary of 350 parts  \nper million (ppm) above the pre-industrial level. 41 We’ve \nnow surpassed 390 ppm CO 2 in the atmosphere. The loss \nof summer polar sea-ice is almost certainly irreversible. \nThis is one example of a well-defined threshold that, \nwhen breached, gravely impacts the Earth system.\n42\nOcean acidification\nThis is a reduction in the ocean’s PH due to CO 2 \nabsorption: around one-quarter of our CO 2 emissions \ndissolve in the ocean. 43 This makes it difficult for \nessential marine life to survive. Unlike most other  \nhuman impacts on the marine environment, which \nare often local in scale, this boundary has global \nramifications. It is also an example of how tightly \ninterconnected the boundaries are, as atmospheric  \nCO\n2 concentration is the underlying variable for both  \nthe climate change and ocean acidification boundaries.\nSafe Close to  \novershooting\nLegend\nOvershot\nTHE PLANETARY BOUNDARIES FRAMEWORK\nFOUR KEY SYSTEMS TO REVERSE \nTHE OVERSHOOT\nBUILT ENVIRONMENT\nThe construction, use and maintenance of \ncommon, man-made physical structures. \nThese include residential and commercial \nbuildings, as well as infrastructure such as \nroads, bridges and dams.\nMOBILITY AND TRANSPORT\nAll of the activities (including fuels and \nvehicles) involved in moving goods and \npeople from point A to B over land,  \nwater and air. \nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n29\n28\n\n\nCLIM ATE CHANGE\nLAND\n SYSTEM\n CH\nA\nN\nG\nE\nNITROGEN CYCLE\nPHO SPHO RUS CYCLE\nO\nCEAN ACIDIFICATION\nFRESH\nW\nATER USE\nAEROSOL LOADING\n200%\n0%\n-200%\n-145%\n-190%\n-62%\n-47%\n-56%\nFrom 13% above the boundary\nto 43%  below the boundary. \nFrom 59%  to  62%\nbelow the boundary. \nFrom 87%  to  93%\nbelow the boundary. \nFrom 33% above the boundary\nto 14% below the boundary. \nCIRCULAR SOLUTIONS HAVE THE POWER\nTO REVERSE THE OVERSHOOT\nFigure three shows the impact the 16 circular solutions have \non reversing the overshoot of five planetary boundaries.\nIf a circular economy was implemented across these \nfour global systems, virgin material extraction could \ndrop by around one-third ( 34%)—from 92.7 billion \ntonnes to 61.2 billion tonnes. \nGHG emissions could be reduced enough to limit \nglobal temperature rise to 2-degrees. 52 And crucially, \nthe current overshoot of five planetary boundaries \ncould be reversed.*\nUnderpinning our entire analysis is an assumption that \nthe global economy fully transitions to clean energy.  \nThis would involve transforming the electricity mix so \nthat 75% of the electricity currently powered by current \nfossil fuels (coal, natural gas and petroleum derivatives) \nis replaced by renewables, phasing out fossil fuel use for \nindustrial purposes (heat and steam)—with the exception \nof hard to abate industries like steel production and \nfossil fuels extraction activities. Constraining material \ninputs, particularly for highly impactful fossil fuels, \nresults in an 8% reduction in the material footprint.\n54 \nIn terms of emissions (the climate change planetary \nboundary), the largest reduction of all circular \nsolutions comes from shifting to renewable electricity: \na reduction of 77%. We do not examine this scenario in \ndetail in the report.\n*Although we were only able to model the transgression of \nsix planetary boundaries (in the framework, phosphorus and \nnitrogen cycles are both contained within Biogeochemical \nflows), we added to the eight planetary boundaries known \nto have been previously quantified. Measuring stratospheric \nozone layer depletion was not possible. According to \nRockstrom and colleagues, this boundary is transgressed \nonly temporarily in Antarctica each spring. Biodiversity loss \nand chemical pollution could also not be modelled.

And more often than not, where \nincomes rise consumers spend their extra money \non meat: meat consumption has more than doubled \nsince 1990.\n57 Ultimately, future food demand could \nincrease by 35 to 56% by 2050. 58\nHowever, food production cannot keep expanding \nindefinitely: it is the single largest driver of ecological \nimpact and transgression of planetary boundaries.\n59 \nWhile all food production comes with environmental \ncosts, the bulk of these are partly due to the huge \nswathes of land dedicated to industrially  growing what \nwe—or livestock—eat: agricultural activities now occupy \nroughly half of the habitable surface of the planet \nand industrial practices decimate biodiversity, soil \nhealth and more. Livestock production is particularly \nimpactful.\n60 61 For example, it occupies around two-\nfifths of the planet’s usable land surface. Fishing and \naquaculture also generate significant environmental \nimpacts on marine and freshwater ecosystems, water \nuse and quality, and biodiversity loss, through activities \nsuch as overfishing, trawling, and chemical and plastic \npollution, for example.\n62 63 Further, huge amounts of \nconsumer-ready food is wasted, marking a huge loss \nof not only nutritional resources but also energy, \nlabour and land. Waste occurs both at the farm—14% \nof the world’s food waste occurs during post-harvest \nproduction and processing phases\n64 —and at the \nconsumer end. Often, current food practices focus on \nmaximising food production, rather than delivering \nhealthy and nutrient-dense food—there are not only \nenvironmental, but also health costs to business-as-\nusual. Overall, food production practices are highly \nimpactful on planetary boundaries:\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS BY FAR THE LARGEST \nDRIVER OF LAND-USE CHANGE GLOBALLY\n65\nIn terms of land footprint, agriculture is by far the most \nimpactful: around 7% of global land use is allocated to \ncrops,\n66 which is equivalent to the size of East Asia, and \nlivestock production alone occupies over one-quarter \n(27%) of global land use, equivalent to the size of the \nAmericas.\n67 The production of lost and wasted food \nglobally accounts for 23% of global cropland. 68\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS A MAJOR DRIVER \nOF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OCEAN \nACIDIFICATION\nIt makes up one-third of GHG emissions,\n69 while animal \nhusbandry alone is linked to about 14.5% of global \nGHG emissions. 70 The production of lost and wasted \nfood globally accounts for between 8 and 10% of global \nGHG emissions.\n71\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE \nFOR 70% OF THE GLOBAL ACCESSIBLE \nFRESHWATER WITHDRAWALS THROUGH \nIRRIGATION\n72\nGlobally, water demand from agriculture has more \nthan doubled between 1960 and 2000.\n73 Food waste \nalone is responsible for 24% of total freshwater \nresources used in food production.\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM CONTRIBUTES TO THE \nVAST MAJORITY OF NUTRIENT OVERLOAD\nExcessive use of synthetic fertilisers has resulted in an \noverload of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. \nLivestock production alone is responsible for about \none-third of global nitrogen mobilisation, enough \nto meet the entire ‘planetary budget’ for nutrient \noverload.\n74 The production of lost and wasted food \nglobally accounts for 23% of global fertiliser use. 75\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS THE SINGLE LARGEST \nDRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n76\nHuman land use change for food production results \nin habitat loss and fragmentation, driving biodiversity \nloss and soil degradation.\n77 78\nCIRCULAR SOLUTIONS \nFOR THE FOOD SYSTEM\nThe unique properties of the global food trade and \nthe importance of food as a basic human need—and \nright—necessitate a systemic approach to sustainable \nfood production and consumption for a planet of 8 \nbillion people. This modelled scenario shows that \nglobal food production can be done in a circular \nmanner; it is not necessary to sacrifice crop yields to \nreduce environmental impacts\n79 if food systems are \ndesigned on closed nutrient cycling, water-nutrient \nmanagement is improved, and symbiosis is ingrained \nwithin and between systems that are regenerative. \nChanging food consumption is also key: reducing \nhigh-impact foods, such as meat, as well as excessive \ncaloric intake, and cutting food waste across the value \nchain (but particularly at the post consumer stage) are \nfundamental if the global food system is to remain \nwithin planetary boundaries.\n80 81 According to our \nanalysis, applying these four circular solutions to this \nsystem could help reverse the global overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries:\n1. PUT HEALTHIER, SATIATING FOODS \nFIRST\nHealthy daily calorie intakes are averaged \nat around 2,600.\n82 Prioritise satiating and \nhealthy foods with a lower environmental \nimpact—ideally shifting calories from \nmeat, fish and dairy towards cereals, fruits, \nvegetables and nuts.\n2. GO LOCAL, SEASONAL AND \nORGANIC\nPrioritise the production and consumption of \nlocal, seasonal and organic produce, which  \ncan lead to a reduced need for fertiliser, \nheating fuels, and transportation and \nprocessing services.\n4. NO MORE AVOIDABLE FOOD \nWASTE\nAbolish food waste along the supply chain \nand at the consumer level through better \nmanagement of transport and storage, \nmore refrigeration and smart planning, and \ntechnology at the consumer and food  \nservice levels.\n3. MAINSTREAM REGENERATIVE \nAGRICULTURE\nScale up regenerative and circular agricultural \nprocesses that encourage closed nutrient \nloops. This model supports healthy soils \nand ultimately keeps the land arable for far \nlonger than typical farming processes. If \nmeat remains in our diets, it should be reared \nwithin this model. \nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n33\n32\n\n\nBUILD A CIRCULAR \nBUILT ENVIRONMENT2\nHousing and providing services for the world’s \nrapidly urbanising population—especially in \nBuild and Grow countries—will inevitably require \nadditional material use. Yet crucial construction \nmaterials are already becoming scarce due to \noveruse and rising incomes have shaped an \nappetite for bigger homes and ultimately more \nspace—also driven by a rising trend for living \nalone in Shift countries. 83 The quick build-up of \ncities without smart urban planning has also \ncontributed to urban sprawl, leading to high car \ndependency, air and noise pollution and excessive \nmaterial use. 84 But it’s not only about the material \nuse involved in the construction of buildings: the \nway in which these are built will substantially \ninfluence material demand during their use phase, \nfrom energy efficiency to the lifetime extension \nof buildings themselves. Today, due to a lack of \ncircular design and integrated planning, buildings \nalready in use are major carbon emitters, claiming \nnearly one-third of global energy consumption. 85\nOur need for buildings and infrastructure is one of \nthe most impactful: worldwide, construction and \ndemolition drives nearly one-third of total material \nconsumption, and generates a similar portion of \nwaste. 86 Particularly over the past two decades, \nsoaring demand from the construction industry  \nhas caused the extraction of non-metallic minerals—\nespecially sand and gravel—to triple, 87 with sand \nbeing taken from the Earth more quickly than it can \nbe replenished. 88 After clean water, sand is the world’s \nmost used resource. The (often unregulated) mining \nof these materials, production and transport of \nconstruction materials, and building operations and \nend-of-life waste management of the construction \nand demolition phase drive a range of climate-related \ndisasters and planetary boundary impacts:\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS RESPONSIBLE \nFOR ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF LAND \nSYSTEM CHANGE\nHowever, the built environment (including villages, \ntowns, cities and infrastructure) is estimated to occupy \njust 1% of global land surface, or about 60 million \nhectares. 89 Through the extraction of the minerals \nnecessary to produce construction materials and the \nemissions it generates, it is responsible for habitat \ndestruction and consequently, biodiversity loss. 90 91 92\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS A MAJOR \nDRIVER OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OCEAN \nACIDIFICATION\nApproximately 40% of global GHG emissions can \nbe attributed to buildings’ construction, use and \ndemolition. Upstream activities, such as the production \nof building materials, are energy-intensive processes \nthat generate vast amounts of GHG emissions: cement \nproduction alone contributes around 7% of global \nCO2 emissions. 93 Buildings are also major energy \nconsumers and thus emitters: building operations are \nresponsible for approximately 55% of global electricity \nconsumption, for example. 94\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT DRIVES WATER \nSTRESS\nSand and gravel extraction disrupt water supplies, \nhydrological functions and river and coastal \necosystems. 95 The production of construction  \nmaterials such as cement, steel and glass are  \nwater-intensive processes. 96 97\nThe built environment is essential, yet the way we \ndesign our built-up spaces to deliver these needs \ndetermines the material demand to follow—thereby \neither greatly impacting or benefiting the environment. \nWith circular economy design principles at the core,  \nthe circular solutions identified in this report show \nthat we can create a modern and efficient built \nenvironment with significantly less impact on the \ncrucial life support systems of the planet. According to \nour analysis, applying these four circular solutions to \nthis system could help reverse the global overshoot  \nof planetary boundaries:\n5. BE AS ENERGY EFFICIENT AS \nPOSSIBLE\nFrom the design phase, utilise circular \nstrategies to create material- and energy-\nefficient buildings, through the ‘passivhaus’ \napproach, for example. Couple these designs \nwith a roll out of clean energy solutions: for \nexample, low-carbon heating and cooling \napproaches such as heat pumps. Prioritise \nenergy efficient appliances, wash at lower \ntemperatures and lower thermostat settings \nby a few degrees. Overall, radically reduce \nenergy and material demands.\n6. MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT \nALREADY EXISTS\nThere are already huge amounts of materials \nlocked into existing buildings—make the \nmost of them by reusing, repurposing and \nrenovating with secondary materials. Where \nnew builds are needed, be as efficient as \npossible with urban planning solutions that \nfollow circular design principles so that \nbuildings can be reused, repurposed or easily \ndisassembled in the future.\n7. PRIORITISE CIRCULAR MATERIALS \nAND APPROACHES\nA huge range of circular approaches can \ncut the emissions and material intensity of \nbuildings. Transition to using wood, timber or \ncross-laminated timber instead of steel and \nconcrete, or move to other locally available \nmaterials. Utilise mainstream modular \nconstruction and prioritise lightweight frames \nand structures to reduce cement and steel \nuse, as well as green roofs where possible.\n8. REUSE WASTE\nMaximise the high-value reuse of buildings \nand components where possible. Ideally, \nmake construction and demolition waste \na thing of the past, but where it cannot be \navoided: ensure that as much of it as possible \nis recycled to avoid the need for virgin \nmaterials, such as sand and gravel.\nCIRCULAR SOLUTIONS \nFOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n35\n34\n\n\nACHIEVE CIRCULAR \nMANUFACTURED GOODS \nAND CONSUMABLES3\nHeavy industry and manufacturing kick-started \nthe Anthropocene: our current geological epoch, \nin which human activity is the main driver of Earth \nsystem changes. The impacts of the industrial \nsystem stem from two main factors: the scale of \nproduction (and consumption), and production \nprocesses themselves. The mechanisation of \nproduction—occurring during the Industrial \nRevolution—was and continues to be tightly linked \nwith high energy use, particularly fossil fuels. It \nalso enabled mass consumption, as consumption \nis both the driver and goal of the expansion of \nproduction. Therefore, the environmental impacts \nof industrial activities occur across the entire \nlifecycle: from material extraction to processing and \nend-of-life. Mining of the metals that are crucial for \nmanufacturing has spurred serious environmental \nand social consequences. Mining processes create \nvast quantities of waste rock and toxic waste.\n98 \nIndustrial production processes are similarly \nimportant—since they determine system efficiency \nand thus influence energy and material use—and \nimpactful: this analysis estimates that over one-\nquarter (28% or 9.8 billion tonnes) of global solid \nwaste generation is industrial waste. Similarly, \nwhile industrial activities are highly energy-\nintensive (often fossil fuels), much of industry’s vast \nenergy consumption is lost as waste heat.\n99\nThe entire lifecycle of other product streams such \nas steel (and other metals), paper and cardboard, \nchemicals, textiles manufacturing, and plastics \nproduction are also highly impactful. The production of \nsteel and other metals is highly energy- and material-\nintensive, representing around 10% of global primary \nenergy demand,\n100 and thus represents a significant \namount of the share of the environmental footprint \nof industrial systems.\n101 Similarly, textiles production \nand consumption has exploded during the last two \ndecades: with production doubling between the years \n2000 and 2014, and the average consumer buying \nmany more pieces, yet each clothing item now being \nkept half as long.\n102 This makes textiles responsible for \nsubstantial environmental impacts, including a hefty \ncarbon footprint (up to 10% of GHG emissions\n103), \nchemical pollution, and waste generation. 104 Plastics \nare ubiquitous in modern society but they are also \nespecially problematic: production has doubled since \nthe year 2000, and waste and pollution are growing \nrelentlessly,\n105 with highly impactful environmental \nconsequences on land and sea as well as with dire \nsocial consequences attached.\n106 107 Some of this \nsystem’s planetary boundary impacts include:\nTHE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE \nFOR LAND-SYSTEMS CHANGE\nAs heavy, material- and energy-intensive industrial \nactivities that primarily consume metals and fossil \nfuels, manufacturing is linked to deforestation and \nland use change,\n108 109 110 111 particularly in the tropics, 112 \ndirectly impacting ecosystem destruction 113 and \nbiodiversity loss. 114\nTHE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM ACCOUNTS FOR \nAPPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF GLOBAL \nGHG EMISSIONS\n115\nBecause around three-quarters of its processes’ \nenergy demands are met by coal, steel production \nalone generates more emissions than all road freight,\n116 \nfor example. 117\nTHE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM DRIVES \nCHEMICAL POLLUTION OVERSHOOT AND \nTHE RELEASE OF NOVEL ENTITIES\n118\nIncreased production and release of chemicals and \nplastics pollution present a wide range of adverse \nenvironmental impacts and on (other) biophysical \nprocesses, including water stress,\n119 120 soil health and \nbiosphere integrity, among others. 121\nThe manufacturing industry is rife with opportunity to \ndo better by drawing on circular strategies that boost \nefficiency, get more from less, minimise pollution \nand consider social justice measures. Extractive and \nmanufacturing industries will need to continue into the \nfuture to fuel our collective demand for materials and \nto support the large-scale deployment of renewable \nenergy infrastructure. It is critical that, in addition to \nthe adoption of sustainable practices, individual  \nand community livelihoods are protected well into  \nthe future. Curbing material demand will be crucial  \nto decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors—iron, steel and \naluminium manufacturing, for example. According to \nour analysis, applying these four circular solutions to \nthis system could help reverse the global overshoot  \nof planetary boundaries:\n9. MAINSTREAM INDUSTRIAL \nSYMBIOSIS AND EFFICIENCY\nAchieve process improvements, scrap \ndiversion and reduction in yield losses \nthrough greater industrial symbiosis and \nefficiency. Foster tighter collaboration within \nand between industries to deliver powerful \nmaterial and emissions savings.\n10. EXTEND THE LIFETIME OF \nMACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND \nGOODS\nMaximising the lifetime of goods that  \nserve our daily needs can bring a number of \nenvironmental benefits. Decrease the costs \nto repair, remanufacture, upgrade and reuse \nthrough circular business models, material \nsubstitution, or regulations on the minimum  \nguarantee of products.\n11. BUY WHAT YOU NEED\nReduce the purchases of common electronic \ngoods, appliances and other equipment to \nsufficiency levels. This shift is assumed to be \nsupported by a combination of policies such \nas a raw material tax, but also service-based \ncircular business models like sharing  \nor pay-per-use. \n12. ESCHEW FAST FASHION IN \nFAVOUR OF SUSTAINABLE \nTEXTILES\nPrioritise natural and local textile \nmanufacturing, as well as higher-quality and \nmore durable garments. All used clothing \nshould go on to be reused or, if needed, \nrecycled appropriately. Industry shifts to \nencourage the large-scale deployment of \nsustainable production speed this process up.\nCIRCULAR SOLUTIONS \nFOR MANUFACTURED GOODS \nAND CONSUMABLES\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n37\n36\n\n\nDRIVE FORWARD CIRCULAR \nMOBILITY AND TRANSPORT4\nTransport systems are among the most impactful \nglobally: heavily material-intensive and high \nconsumers of fossil fuels, they fragment natural \nenvironments, often causing harm to ecosystem \nfunctions. These impacts aren’t set to reverse: the \ndemand for transport is trending strongly upwards \nall around the world,\n122 and left unchecked, \nemissions from the transport system could grow by \n60% by 2050.\n123\nTransport is the single largest driver of oil demand \nworldwide, claiming around 60% of the total, and \naccounting for nearly one-third of final energy use.\n124 \nOur oil and transport dependence is causing emissions \nto spiral. Passenger cars are the most common vehicle, \nand because most of them are powered with internal \ncombustion engines, they are the largest source of \nemissions.\n125 The number of vehicles worldwide has \nincreased significantly during the last two decades, \nparticularly passenger cars.\n126 Similarly, aviation, \ndespite representing a relatively smaller share of \nemissions for transport compared to road transport, \nis the fastest growing source of emissions within the \nsystem.\n127 However, inequality within and between \ncountries is vast. For example, the richest half of the \nworld (high- and upper-middle income countries) \nare responsible for 90% of air travel emissions, while \nlower-middle income countries emit just 1%.\n128 But \ntransport and mobility networks, including not only the \nvehicles but the physical infrastructure that underpins \nthem, generate significant environmental pressures. \nThe bottom line: our need for transport—and our \nlargely linear way of meeting this need—leads to:\nTHE TRANSPORT SYSTEM IS A MAJOR \nDRIVER OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OCEAN \nACIDIFICATION, ACCOUNTING FOR \nAPPROXIMATELY 25% OF GHG EMISSIONS \nGLOBALLY\nRoad transport and air travel concentrate the bulk of \nemissions from the transport system: around 85% of \nthe total.\n129 Mainly—although not only—due to its high \ncarbon footprint, transport and mobility are also major \ndrivers of ocean acidification.\n130\nTHE TRANSPORT SYSTEM DRIVES LAND \nUSE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\nFor example, the development of land-based \ntransportation infrastructure, particularly the \nconstruction and expansion of major road corridors, \noften leads to deforestation, landscape alteration, and \nbiodiversity loss.\n131 132 133 Transport, a core component \nof international trade, has also been found to increase \ndeforestation.\n134 Still, shipping and cruises that release \nharmful pollutants into the water lead to marine litter \nthat severely impacts biodiversity.\n135\nTransiting transport and mobility towards \nsustainability is a multidimensional process, and \nkey to reducing environmental pressures globally.\n136 \nIt’s crucial for emissions from transport and \nmobility to decrease sharply in the coming years, \nthrough decarbonisation and the higher uptake of \nactive transport modes: walking and biking, where \npossible. The circular economy provides a wealth of \nopportunities to make all these aims a reality. With \ncircular economy design principles at the core, our \nscenarios show that we can create healthy and efficient \nfreight and transport systems for the future with \nsignificantly less impact on the planet. According to our  \nanalysis, applying these four circular solutions to  \nthis system could help reverse the global overshoot  \nof planetary boundaries: \n13. EMBRACE CAR-FREE LIFESTYLES \nAND ROADS\nSwap car purchases for bikes and ride-sharing \ninitiatives—especially in urban areas. A \nboost in virtual work reduces the number of \nkilometres travelled for commuting. This shift \nencourages better utilisation of spatial assets \nand former office spaces in urban settings.\n14. INVEST IN HIGH-QUALITY PUBLIC \nTRANSPORT\nBoost the use of public transport, including \nbus, tram and rail networks. In adapting \nour infrastructure, extra care can also be \ngiven to creating safer cycling routes and \npedestrianised city centres—ultimately \nimproving the liveability of regions and cities.\n16. ELECTRIFY REMAINING VEHICLES\nElectrify public transport vehicles along with \n50% of all privately owned cars.\n15. RETHINK AIR-TRAVEL\nMinimise personal air travel, especially in \nregions with the most demand for long-haul \nair travel, such as North America, Europe  \nand Asia.\nCIRCULAR SOLUTIONS \nFOR MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n39\n38\n\n\nCOUNTRIES,\nCIRCULAR\nSOLUTIONS\nDIFFERENT\nDIFFERENT\n4\nTAILORED CIRCULAR \nPATHWAYS\nOur modelling shows how just 16 circular solutions \ncan bring global planetary boundaries back within \nsafe limits. However, translating these theoretical \nsolutions into widespread practice will require a \ncomprehensive understanding of how solutions \ncan be best adapted to local contexts around the \nworld. This chapter builds on the country profiles \nintroduced in the Circularity Gap Report 2020 , which \nallow us to prioritise circular solutions based on \ncountries’ performance on human development \nand ecological impact.\n137 Whilst recognising that \nno single country can ever be a perfect match for \nall the criteria of any one profile, it is important \nto present a wide range of circular solutions that \ncan be adapted to optimise wellbeing within \nthe country context, by combining technology, \nbusiness and policy.\nMYTH-BUSTING: POPULATION GROWTH \nDOES NOT LEAD TO OVERSHOOT\nThe previous chapter demonstrated the disconnect \nbetween human activity and the planet upon which \nwe rely to live. As the global population grows \nand incomes rise—importantly lifting many out of \npoverty—consumption also rises. But increasing \nconsumption beyond a point results in diminishing \nreturns for wellbeing, and is detrimental to the \nplanet, which further impacts the wellbeing of future \ngenerations. We need to think critically about how to \nstrike a balance for the planet and all of its people, \nwhich urges us to redefine progress and look beyond \nonly short-term impacts. As many have pointed \nout before, our current measuring stick of GDP for \nprogress isn’t always effective—it’s sometimes even \ncounterintuitive. The destruction of natural carbon \nsinks that are home to thousands of species is a good \nmove for short-term economic growth, but not the  \nenvironment, for example.\nOur analysis locates numerous national examples \nwhere a spike in material use has been to the \ndetriment of wellbeing indicators, such as life \nexpectancy, nutrition, democratic quality, equality, \neducation, access to energy and social support, \namong others. Singapore and Lithuania had the \nlargest material footprint increase of the 148 countries \nstudied\n138 in the period 2005 to 2015, yet Lithuania \nrecorded no average growth across wellbeing \nindicators (a small increase in life expectancy was \ncompensated by a small decrease in life satisfaction) \nand Singapore achieved only a very small average \nincrease (mostly by increasing employment). This \nstarkly contrasts countries such as Angola, Eswatini, \nTogo, Nepal, The Gambia and South Africa, which \nmarked strong progress on several wellbeing \nindicators yet had stable, and even declining,  \nmaterial footprints. This indicates that to better  \nalign increasingly scarce and competed for materials \nwith the essential needs of people, additional  \nmaterials should be directed towards countries \nwhere material scarcity hampers progress on basic \nwellbeing—rather than countries whose material \nneeds are more than satisfied.\nTo this end, this report takes a similar approach. While \nit finds that circular solutions across key systems can \ncut global material demand by about one-third (34%) \nand reverse the overshoot, it is important to note that \nthis reduction should not be equally shouldered across \ncountries. Shift  countries are responsible for most of \nthe overshoot, and often carry a material footprint that \nis double or even triple the global average.\n139\nBUILD, GROW, SHIFT: THREE COUNTRY \nPROFILES\nDespite clear divergences between countries, we can \nstill discern which circular economy interventions \nwill be most suitable in certain contexts based on \nclear common needs and structural parallels. In our \n2020 analysis, we took 176 countries and scored \nthem on their social performance (measured by a \nHuman Development Index score) and their ecological \nfootprint\n140 to assess how far they were from the \nend goal: a socially just and ecologically safe space. \nOur overarching finding was illuminating: no country \nresides within a safe and just space today. Some \ncountries are close, others are far away; each starts \nfrom a different point on the map, but all have a \ndistance to go. The position of each country in this \nanalysis helps us form the three broad country \nprofiles, which may exhibit some overlaps but overall \nallow us to highlight key common themes that are \ncentral to development pathways.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n41\n40\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nEcologically \nsafe and \nsocially just \nspace\nBUILD\nBuild countries live within planetary \nboundaries, but still need to build an \neconomic system that satisfies their society’s \nbasic needs.They are home to 46% of the \nglobal population. They currently transgress \nfew planetary boundaries, if any at all, but \nstruggle to meet their basic needs, such as \neducation and healthcare, and therefore \nscore low on Human Development Index (HDI) \nindicators. Their economies are dominated by \nagriculture and forestry, and they are building \nbasic infrastructure. The Build profile is \nmost relevant to countries in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, South Asian countries and some \nsmall island states. The larger countries by \npopulation to which the profile may apply \nare India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, \nPakistan and the Philippines.\nSHIFT\nHigher-income Shift  countries need to shift \naway from over-consuming the planet’s \nmaterials in servicing their relatively affluent \nand comfortable lifestyles (although \ninequalities within Shift  countries are rife). \nThey are home to a minority of the world’s \npopulation but consume 31% of materials and \ngenerate 43% of emissions. Per capita, Shift \ncountries are the largest consumers across \nall material groups; their extraction of fossil \nfuels is relatively high, as is their participation \nin global trade. So, despite high HDI scores \nand comfortable lifestyles, these countries \nhave a way to go to limit their consumption in \nline with our planet’s boundaries. The Shift \nprofile fits best with the higher-income \ncountries in the Global North, in the Gulf, \nAustralia and Oceania. The larger ones \ninclude the US, Japan, Canada, Argentina \nand Member States of the European Union.\nGROW\nLargely middle-income, Grow countries need \nto continue growing in a way that satisfies \ntheir societal needs, but within planetary \nboundaries. They are home to 37% of the \nworld’s population, and are industrialising \nrapidly and building infrastructure to lift their \npopulations out of poverty and accommodate \na growing middle class. They are global \nmanufacturing hubs and the world’s biggest \nagricultural producers. They use 51% of \nmaterials and generate 41% of emissions. \nThe Grow profile is most relevant to \ncountries in Latin America and Northern \nAfrica, as well as those with an economy in \ntransition in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus \nand Central Asia, plus larger Southeast \nAsian countries. The largest countries in \nthis group are China, Indonesia, Brazil, \nMexico, Vietnam, Myanmar and Egypt.\nFigure four shows how 176 countries score on the Human Development \nIndex (HDI) and the Ecological Footprint combined; three country profiles \nemerge with different distances to a safe and just operating space for \nhumanity (the rectangular box on the bottom right).\nHuman Development Index (HDI)\nEcological Footprint per capita\n(displayed as the number of planets needed to sustain \nthe lifestyle of each country’s average citizen)\nShift  countries\nGrow  countries\nBuild  countries\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n43\n42\n\n\nBUILD\nBuild countries have the opportunity to dramatically \nlift wellbeing by balancing leapfrogging technologies \nwith policies that support local skills and needs for \nmaterial-smart growth.\n1. TRANSFORM THE  \nFOOD SYSTEM\nBuild nations have predominantly agrarian, biomass-\nbased economies where agriculture is central to \nthe economy. Our analysis finds that over half of \ntotal material input to these economies is made \nup of biomass, and the vast majority of all waste \ngenerated is agricultural. Agriculture also makes up \nalmost 60% of the total workforce, thereby holding an \nenormous potential to improve livelihoods.\n141 The vast \nmajority of farmers own small-scale operations or are \npastoralists who depend on the food they can produce \non their own. Malnutrition and poverty are key social \nchallenges, largely due to poor soil conditions, climatic \nrisks and lacking supply chain infrastructure.\n142 \nOne of the key challenges for Build countries is to \nfoster adaptive and regenerative food systems that \nbuild ecosystem health, and yield multiple sources \nof income for producers, while ensuring scalable \ninfrastructure is in place to secure food supply to \nsurrounding populations. Circular economy solutions \ncan be strengthened by combining material-smart \ntechnologies with regenerative and adaptive principles \nfor agricultural production, as well as taking into \naccount low-tech, human-centred designs that are \ncompatible with low material use and community \npreferences. Build countries should focus on circular \nsolution numbers: One, Two and Four (see page 33).\nOne-acre farm is a highly profitable, mixed \nfarm near Lake Victoria in Uganda\nBy reinforcing regenerative processes, the  \nfarm generates multiple revenue streams  \nestimated at €95,000 per year —more than  \nten times the average Ugandan salary.  \nBeneficial exchanges of materials take place \nfarm-wide: nothing goes to waste—maggots, \nfor example, are grown on pig waste to feed to \nchicken and fish. The farm requires 80% less  \nfeed and input costs, and produces multiple  \ncrops and by-products such as biogas.\n143 \nRegenerative agriculture offers a powerful  \nlever to boost local employment,  while  \ncritically improving soil quality and  \necosystem services, which protect the  \nlivelihoods of future generations.\nColdHubs offers affordable subscription \nmodels that can boost access to cold chain \nsolutions\nTo ensure that regenerative agricultural products \nreach consumers, adequate distribution \ninfrastructure is needed: ColdHubs is a post-\nharvest, solar-powered, Cooling-as-Service \nsolution in Nigeria. The 24 operational ColdHubs \nsaved 20,400 tonnes of food from spoilage, \nincreased the household income of over 3,500 \nsmallholders, retailers and wholesalers by 50%, \ncreated 48 new jobs for women and mitigated \n462 tonnes of CO\n2 emissions , with an annual \nenergy consumption reduction of 547 kilowatt-\nhours. ColdHubs offers farmers a flexible pay-as-\nyou-store subscription model at rates that they \ncan afford, helping to tackle the barrier of access \nto financing for cold chain solutions.\n144\n2. BUILD A CIRCULAR BUILT \nENVIRONMENT\nBuild nations have fast growing and urbanising \npopulations largely living in informal settlements with \nlimited access to basic services. The majority of the \n1.6 billion people that live without adequate shelter \nworldwide\n145 live in Build nations.146 This has ripple \neffects across the built environment: a lack of access \nto public transport, mounting waste and poor waste \nmanagement, and increased air pollution.\n147 At the \nsame time, many Build nations house rich ecosystems, \nyet high levels of extraction of sand, gravel and \nlimestone, and iron ores for use in the construction \nindustry have majorly impacted the landscape and \nspurred biodiversity loss.\n148 149 For example, in The \nGambia, 20% of all material use relates to construction, \nand over 50% of construction materials stem from \nnon-renewable sources. The import of construction \nmaterials and metals constitute 24% of imported \nembodied carbon. Next to this, the extraction of sand \nand gravel to produce concrete threatens forest stock, \nincluding community-managed forests, which provide \nvaluable livelihoods.\n150 A key challenge for the built \nenvironment in Build  countries is to develop efficient \nand adaptive infrastructure and housing systems  \nwhile not undermining the ecosystems that provide \nessential resources. Circular economy principles can  \nbe applied throughout the built environment to  \ndeliver on these goals. Build countries should  \nfocus on circular solution numbers: Five, Seven  \nand Eight (see page 35).  \nEarthwork is a local, low-impact building \nmethod\nCompressed earth bricks—made from soil, \nnatural fibres and clay—can last for centuries, \nare easy to repair and boast a very low carbon \nfootprint.\n151 Worofila, Earthwork Construction  \nand Elementerre are companies in Africa that  \nare reviving earth-based construction methods, \nand reaping the benefits.\n152 One example of \nearthwork construction cut embodied energy  \nby 95% compared to a similar traditional  \nconcrete block construction. 153\nClimate adaptive building must bring together \nlocal materials, labour and knowledge\nThe Friendship Hospital in Bangladesh was \nbuilt to serve some of the most vulnerable \npopulations. Its construction employed local \ncraftsmen to make the most of local knowledge: \nthe building process addressed many climate \nconcerns, by utilising local building materials, \nusing surrounding water as a passive cooling \nmethod, and harvesting rainwater for reuse, \nfor example.\n154 The building’s environmental \nimpact was minimised, while ensuring trust and \nlegitimacy among the local population —and \nshaping a beneficial environment for the mental \nand physical health of the hospital’s patients.\n155 \nClimate justice and unequal access to healthcare \nwere central concerns, as was the use of \nsustainable, local building materials—serving to \ncut emissions and lower waste.\n156\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n45\n44\n\n\n3. ACHIEVE CIRCULAR \nMANUFACTURED GOODS AND \nCONSUMABLES\nBuild countries typically do not have extensive \nmanufacturing industries. 157 As a result, energy and \nfossil fuel use is low. Material extraction and use \nand waste generated is also low—just 13% of the \nglobal material footprint and only 11% of global solid \nwaste. However, they do incur disproportionate social \nimpacts at the two ends of the supply chain: global \nextraction and waste management activities. Mining \nactivities in Build countries have infamously led to \nthe displacement of populations, violent conflict and \nhuman rights violations.\n158 At the same time, once \nproducts from material streams such as textiles, \nplastics, and electronics reach their end-of-life, they \nare shipped from Shift  countries—often illegally.\n159 160 \n161 The majority of Build countries have highly informal \nwaste management sectors that process very toxic\nconsumer goods—often imported from abroad. 162 This \nleads to the disposal of harmful substances but also \nlost value since many products can be repaired.\n163 164 \nA circular economy can help these countries leapfrog \nto sustainable industrial activities, particularly when \ncapitalising on exponential technologies and system \nefficiencies. The formalisation and revamping of waste \nmanagement holds important potential for improving \nlabour conditions. At the same time, circular strategies \ncan help unlock service-led development, particularly \nfor highly-productive stages of the value chain such \nas technical services, including repair, remanufacture, \nand reuse activities for electronics, machinery and \nequipment, for example. Build  countries should focus \non circular solution numbers: Eleven and Twelve \n(see page 37).\nWEEE centres in Kenya and Nigeria allow for \nthe collection, repair and recycling of e-waste\nKenya established a WEEE centre that collects, \nrepairs, resells and recycles electrical and \nelectronic waste from over 8,000 clients. The \ncentre employs 40 people , and involves over 1,000 \nstaff in collection. In Nigeria, E-waste Producer \nResponsibility Organisation Nigeria (EPRON) \nfinances the collection and processing of e-waste \nby fees and levies charged to producers.\n165 \nEPRON aims to reduce and safely recover the \nover 52,000 tonnes of brominated plastics , 4,000 \ntonnes of lead, 80 tonnes of cadmium and over \n300 kilograms of mercury which are otherwise \nburned or dumped in Nigeria every year\n166 by an \nestimated 100,000 informal waste workers. 167\nThe Circular Fashion Partnership accelerates  \na circular textiles industry in Bangladesh\nThe Partnership connects large suppliers, \nrecyclers and brands operating in Bangladesh \nto build the necessary infrastructure to process \npost-production textile waste and unworn \nclothes.\n168 To date, around 1,500 tonnes of \ntextile waste has been captured through the \nPartnership—which has also hosted more \nthan one hundred summits, masterclasses and \nroundtables convening leaders to drive action \nand create opportunities for collaboration. If \ndeveloped sufficiently, this collaboration can  \nform the basis of a more permanent form of \nindustrial symbiosis, closing the loop on textile \nwaste and losses.\n169\n4. DRIVE FORWARD CIRCULAR \nTRANSPORT\nBuild countries have contributed very little to the \ncurrent overshoot, yet they often lack access to safe, \naffordable, efficient and sustainable transport and \nmobility.\n170 However, this picture is changing with one \nof the fastest vehicle growth rates globally. 171 Driven \nby rapid population and economic growth coupled \nwith urbanisation, Sub-Saharan Africa especially is \ngoing through a mobility revolution. Circular economy \nsolutions and partnerships will be needed to ensure \nthat transport systems can serve the needs of a \nrapidly growing economy, while leapfrogging the \nmaterial-intensive mobility systems that exist today. \nBuild countries should focus on circular solution \nnumbers: Thirteen and Fourteen (see page 39).\nElectric cargo bikes offer solutions for off-road \nfreight transport in rural areas\nReferred to as Steel Birds, these off-road \ncargo bikes are designed by Berlin-based \ncompany Anywhere, but are manufactured in \nmicrofactories in Africa. In urban areas, these \nbikes provide practical and cost-effective \nlogistical ‘last mile’ services , while in rural \nsettings, they can reach remote areas to facilitate \nconnection with villages. The solar panels and \nenergy storage underpinning the bikes help \nestablish a zero-cost microgrid, capable of \nproviding electricity and running water cleaning \nunits for remote populations.\n172\nGlocal public-private partnerships roll out \nlocally manufactured transport for rapidly \nurbanising cities\nSafa Tempo are three-wheeled electric  \nvehicles that became popular as alternatives  \nto polluting Diesel-run Vikram tempos as 1990s \nNepal was hit by rising air pollution and fuel \nscarcity. Introduced with the support of the \nGlobal Resources Institute (GRI) and the United \nStates Agency of International Development \n(USAID), the transport solution provides clean, \ncost-effective, short-distance transport in  \nurban areas . It also boosted gender equality:  \nit was a catalyst for getting women behind the  \nwheel and in the driver’s seat , paving the way  \nfor their empowerment.\n173 174\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n47\n46\n\n\nGROW\nGrow countries can prioritise material-efficient \ndevelopment pathways that maximise societal \nwellbeing for a growing population.\n1. TRANSFORM THE  \nFOOD SYSTEM\nIn Grow countries, rising incomes are paralleled by \nshifts in dietary patterns: particularly an increase in \nhigh impact foods like meat and rising food waste: all \nkey drivers of overshoot and adverse health impacts. \nFor instance, between 1990 to 2019, daily meat \nconsumption per person doubled in Mexico and Brazil, \nand nearly tripled in China, while the share of plant-\nbased proteins went down in all of them.\n175 Today, \nChina alone consumes 28% of the meat produced \nglobally. Increasing affluence has also led to large-\nscale food waste. China, for instance, wastes 6% (or 35 \nmillion tonnes) of the country’s total food production \nper year.\n176 These two trends are a core challenge of \nGrow countries’ food systems: how to ensure adequate \nnutrition for a rapidly growing population that can be \ndecoupled from increasing environmental pressures \nfrom food production and waste. At the same time, \nmany Grow countries are agricultural powerhouses \nand major agro exporters of commodities such as \nsoybeans, poultry, pork and beef. Shifting towards \nmore sustainable and circular production (farming \npractices) and consumption (diets) are key, particularly \nby downscaling most impactful processes (livestock \nproduction and consumption).\n177 Grow countries \nshould focus on circular solution numbers: One, \nTwo, Three and Four (see page 33).\nAlternative low-impact proteins can address \nthe growing food waste challenge\nThai business Global Bugs produces cricket \nprotein: a low-cost, complete source of protein \nand ‘superfood’ that requires one-sixth less feed, \n1/1,000th the amount of water, and 1/20,000th \nthe amount of land compared to the same \namount of beef . Insects also present a unique \nsolution to heightening food waste challenges \nin Grow countries, as they consume low-value \nagricultural waste. Insect protein farm systems \ncan, therefore, be designed in a circular way.\n178\nNew dietary guidelines to cut per capita meat \nconsumption by 2030 have emerged in China\nIn 2022, China introduced new guidelines that \naim to reduce per person meat consumption by \nhalf, listing cultivated meats and other plant-\nbased ‘future foods’ as suitable protein sources \nin its five-year plan. If effective, China’s efforts to \nshift the messaging around healthy diets—with a \nfocus on eating less meat and potentially avoiding \nred meat altogether, prioritising local products \nand reducing food waste—could inspire other \ncountries to adopt a similar approach.\n179 180 \n2. BUILD A CIRCULAR BUILT \nENVIRONMENT\nA sharp increase in material use and waste \ngeneration\n181 has been primarily linked to Grow \ncountries experiencing GDP growth and an expanding \nbuilt environment. Of net additions to stock in 2018, \napproximately two-thirds (65%) occurred in Grow \ncountries. This stock build up is unprecedented in \nhistory and has been the main driver of global material \ndemand growth in the last two decades.\n182 183 Brazil, \nRussia, China and South Africa represent a significant \nportion of the increase in demand for sand and gravel, \nfor example, while China alone accounts for roughly \nhalf of global cement production.\n184 185 A circular built \nenvironment needs to address two core challenges: \nhow to deliver high quality housing and infrastructure \nservices for the world’s fastest growing economies \nwhile leveraging the cutting edge of resource efficient \nsolutions. Grow countries should focus on circular \nsolution numbers: Five, Seven and Eight (see page \n35).\nChiangmai Life Architects implement and scale \ncircular construction strategies\nThis Thailand-based company prioritises natural \nbuilding materials to create homes, offices, \nschools and more: bamboo, rammed earth and \nadobe bricks, for example.\n186 These carbon-\nabsorbing materials can boast a negative carbon \nfootprint , in addition to other benefits: bamboo, \nfor example, is quick-growing, lightweight, strong \nand flexible,\n187 while rammed earth protects \nspaces from excessive heat and cold and is often \nlocally available.\n188 They also have a role to play \nin adaptation to climate change: bamboo has the \nability to heal watersheds during extreme heat, \nwhile also mitigating floods.\n189\nMexico’s EcoCasa Programme supports  \npassive design and resource-efficient housing\nThe EcoCasa programme is managed by the  \nstate-run development bank Sociedad \nHipotecaria Federal, and issues credits for  \nhouses with a 20% reduced energy consumption. \nThe EU funded an extension to this programme, \nsupporting houses with an 80% reduction in \nenergy consumption and that meet the Passive \nHouse Standard.\n190 191 Some EcoCasa buildings \nhave more than 20% less embodied carbon , \nwhile some with additional EDGE certification  \ncut embodied carbon by as much as 44% .192 \nEcoCasa aims to bring more environmental \nconcerns within scope as the programme \ndevelops, eventually hoping to target water use, \ntransport and embodied energy. The programme \nis receiving recognition for its ability to transform \nthe whole construction sector, as well as its \nreplication potential.\n193 \nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n49\n48\n\n\n3. ACHIEVE CIRCULAR \nMANUFACTURED GOODS AND \nCONSUMABLES\nManufacturing is the beating heart of Grow countries, \nmaking up a substantial share of their economies \nand employment. The rapid economic development \nthat has lifted the social foundation of many people \nin these countries has been predominantly led by the \nprocessing and manufacturing of steel, chemicals, \ntextiles and cement. This presents an opportunity \nto improve livelihoods by developing innovative \ncircular economy processes and business models \nfor manufactured goods,\n194 deploying low-carbon \ntechnologies and increasing shares of secondary \nproduction.\n195 A key challenge in pursuing a circular \nmodel for manufacturing is ensuring that there are \nopportunities for highly skilled labour that drive global \ncompetitiveness over the long term, while also making \nsignificant gains in resource efficiency that mitigate \ncrucial impacts to the environment. Grow countries \nshould focus on circular solution numbers: Ten, \nEleven and Twelve (see page 37).\nNatura & Co paves the way to a circular and \nregenerative personal care industry\nBrazil-based Natura & Co is a personal care \nsubsidiary with bold circular economy targets,  \nincluding 20% less packaging, 50% recycled \ncontent, and 100% reusable, recyclable or \ncompostable packaging . Plant-based ingredients \nare prioritised to create its soaps, creams and \nshampoos, and local traditional knowledge is \nused to supplement research and innovation. The \ncompany will deploy Life Cycle Assessments for \nall of its products to ensure lower environmental \nfootprints, and supports regenerative agriculture \nto cut chemical use and create alternative \nrevenue streams for farmers that are more \neconomically attractive than deforestation. \nBy doing so, Natura & Co protects the value of \nhealthy rainforests, bolstering biodiversity.\n196 197 \nEco-industrial parks are transforming the \nVietnamese industrial sector\nThe Vietnamese government set up numerous \nindustrial parks across the country, with the \nfirst established in 1991. Today, there are 326 in \ntotal. The implementation of just 12 industrial \nsymbiosis opportunities could result in a 70,000 \ntonne reduction in emissions, over 885,000 tonne \nreduction in freshwater use, and an 84,000 ton \nreduction in waste  annually.\n198 Eco-industrial \nparks have the potential to create jobs and \nimprove working conditions. 199 In addition, they \ncan provide an array of social infrastructures, \nsuch as vocational training centres and training \ncentres for skills development, among other \ncommunity services.\n200\n4. DRIVE FORWARD CIRCULAR \nTRANSPORT\nGrow countries are experiencing steep increases in \ndemand for personal mobility and freight to serve \neconomic expansion and rising consumption. For \nexample, much of the urban expansion recently \nexperienced in countries such as Mexico and Brazil \ntook place in smaller cities with limited capacity to \nmanage urbanisation and that are disconnected from \nmajor cities. Insufficient urban planning also drives \nenvironmentally unsustainable and costly mobility \npatterns,\n201 especially personal vehicle dependency. \nEmissions are set to swell due to increases in vehicle \nsales across ASEAN and African countries: China and \nIndia alone are expected to account for nearly one-\nthird of global passenger car-related CO\n2 emissions by \n2050.202 Well-integrated public transportation networks \nwill be essential in meeting the mobility demands \nof growing populations, yet they can often take \ndecades to develop. More flexible solutions that rely \non retrofitting vehicles and adapting roads for rapid \ntransit can be a way of expanding access to mobility in \nan affordable and resource-efficient manner. A number \nof countries have already embedded circular economy \nprinciples in their mobility strategies to do just that. \nGrow countries should focus on circular solution \nnumbers: Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen and Sixteen \n(see page 39).\nAnkara continues to electrify old diesel buses\nIn Ankara, Turkey, diesel buses reaching their \nend-of-life are being given a new life as electric \nbuses. The project promotes circular economy \nprinciples by extending the functional lifespan \nof 23 buses by the end of 2022. The buses are \nexpected to gain an additional 15 years of life, \nwhile using 25% less energy.  The conversion \nis estimated to be approximately three times \ncheaper than purchasing a new EV bus.\n203\nShenzhen is set to be the first city in the world \nto electrify all public buses\nWith the ambitious goal to cut emissions, reduce \nnoise pollution and improve air quality, national- \nand city-level policy measures have created \nthe enabling conditions for Shenzhen to deploy \nover 16,000 electric buses and more than 5,000 \ncharging points , incorporating new service \nmodels that incentivise component reuse and \nlong-term value retention. This has allowed for \nShenzhen to cut particulate matter by 4.3 million \ntonnes and carbon emissions by 6,000 tonnes .\n204\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n51\n50\n\n\nSHIFT\nShift countries have largely achieved high levels of \nwellbeing, and can focus fully on minimising their \nimpacts to the environment.\n1. TRANSFORM THE  \nFOOD SYSTEM\nShift  counties are home to large-scale industrial \nagricultural systems, which deliver massive volumes \nof food—yet they also highly impact planetary \nboundaries such as GHG emissions, soil degradation \nand nutrient pollution. 205 Overconsumption of highly \nimpactful foods, such as meat, a high dependence on \nimports, and soaring food waste are also signatures \nof most Shift  countries. In the US, for example, almost \n25% of all food supplied is wasted—going straight \nto landfill, incineration or down the drain. This is \nthe equivalent of 90 billion meals, worth roughly 2% \nof GDP—all while one in eight US citizens are food \ninsecure. 206 Most of this occurs at the points of retail \nand consumption. In the EU, over 50% of edible and \ninedible food waste comes from private households, \nthe majority of which is ‘avoidable’ (around two-thirds), \nfor example. 207 A circular food system can help Shift  \ncountries by introducing more regenerative models \nthat build soil, sequester emissions and tackle food \nwaste. This can be coupled by balancing caloric intake \nand investing in lower-impact sources of protein. These \nstrategies combined can reduce the largest pressures \non planetary boundary transgressions. Shift countries \nshould focus on circular solution numbers: One, \nTwo, Three and Four (see page 33).\nRobotics and machine learning help scale \nregenerative agriculture\nA wave of start-ups are combining biochemistry, \ngenomics, machine learning and automated \nrobotics technologies to develop new methods  \nof precision agriculture, which can reduce the  \nuse of chemical inputs by up to 99% . UK-based \nSmall Robot Company provides solutions as a  \npart of a farming-as-a-service model: robots  \nthat seed and care for individual plants in \nfarmers’ crops, ensuring each one gets the  \nright amount of nutrients and water. 208 While still \nin an early phase, these technologies can support \nthe scale up of regenerative agriculture practices \nsuch as multi cropping and cover cropping. \nMachine learning can help farmers anticipate \nproblems, reduce waste and create adaptive \nstrategies to maximise yields and profits over  \nthe growing season .209\nSouth Korea has transformed its food waste \nrecovery process\nIn 1995, less than 2% of food waste was \nrecycled— a figure that increased to 95% by 2019 \nfollowing a 2005 ban on landfilling food waste .210 \nThis success is thanks to a comprehensive policy \nfeaturing a ‘pay-per-use’ scheme and bins for \nfood waste disposal, which cost an average family \naround €6 per month to use. 211 This organic waste \nis then used to supplement animal feedstock and \nproduce compost for urban farming initiatives. 212\n2. BUILD A CIRCULAR BUILT \nENVIRONMENT\nHistorically, Shift  countries have a high level of \nurbanisation as compared to the rest of the world, \nwith 50 to 80% of the population already living in \nurban areas by the 1950s. 213 Today, almost three-\nquarters of the population in the EU lives in urban \nareas and more than 80% in the US and UK. However, \npopulation growth, urbanisation and growing affluence \nare driving an expansion of the built environment \noutside of highly compact urban areas into suburbs \nand countryside. Some key factors here are the \nincrease of single households, as well as people buying \nbigger homes outside of highly dense urban areas, \nwhere costs are lower and floor space is greater. 214 \nThis phenomenon is characterised by high personal \nvehicle dependency and bigger floor space on average, \nand is a major driver of adverse environmental \nconsequences, such as landscape fragmentation, \nbiodiversity loss, water, air and noise pollution. 215 \nDecreasing household size perversely drives up new \nhousing demand. Smaller household size means lower \nefficiency, increased construction and increased land \nuse—all of which add up to much more resource use \nand environmental impact.  Shift countries should \nfocus on circular solution numbers: Five, Six, Seven \nand Eight (see page 35).\nLow-carbon materials, circular design and \nefficient manufacturing drives down impact\nInternational architecture collective Superuse \nStudios tackles each stage of the construction \nprocess, with a focus on harvesting and reusing \nconstruction materials in its circular designs, 216 \nwhile UK-based Premier Modular specialises in \nfast-tracked and sustainable development of \nmodular buildings. 217 Also based in the UK,  \nTopHat Homes creates houses with significantly \nless embodied carbon: their homes save  \n61,000 kilograms of CO 2 over the life of a  \nhouse, which is just 45% of the CO 2 produced  \nby a traditional home .218\nThe Dutch Environmental Performance of \nBuildings (MPG) method takes a lifecycle \napproach to prioritising sustainability\nThe Dutch government has the ambition to \nhalve virgin material consumption by 2030 219—\nnecessitating an approach that minimises \nbuildings’ impacts across their entire lifecycles. \nMost regulations in the EU and beyond focus on \nthe energy consumption of a building during its \nuse phase, but the MPG brings the environmental \nimpact of the materials used into scope.  As such, \nit addresses the issue that as buildings become \nmore energy-efficient, the climate impact of the \nmaterials they contain increases as a share of \nthe buildings’ total lifecycle impact. 220 In this way, \nthe MPG addresses certain tradeoffs: that more \nenergy-efficient buildings may come with a higher \ncarbon footprint in terms of their materials.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n53\n52\n\n\n3. ACHIEVE CIRCULAR \nMANUFACTURED GOODS AND \nCONSUMABLES\nSince the development of a solid industrial economy \nin the late 19th and 20th centuries, Shift  countries \nhave become more service-oriented.\n221 The ensuing \nprocess of ‘deindustrialisation’ resulted in offshoring \nmany industrial and manufacturing activities—\nparticularly the most energy- and material-intensive—\nto Grow countries, where social and environmental \nregulations are often laxer and less enforced. Despite \nthis transition, the material footprint of consumption \nin Shift  countries is more than 13 times higher than \nlow-income countries.\n222 Essentially, Shift  countries \nhave increased their reliance on the extraction and \nprocessing of materials from elsewhere in the world to \nfuel their excessive consumption of products such as \ntextiles,\n223 plastics 224 and electronics. 225 And inefficient \npractices prevail: many electronics have lifetimes that \nare 2.3 years shorter than their designed or desired \nlifetimes. Currently, the average EU citizen consumes \n18 kilograms of electrical and electronic products \nper year—a high rate compounded by planned \nobsolescence and the lack of repairable designs. \nShift  countries should focus on drastically reducing \nmaterial consumption and maximising the lifetime of \nimpactful products. Regarding production processes: \ndomestically, the focus should be on investing in \ncleaner, low-carbon and material-efficient technologies \nthat reduce the environmental footprint of production \nactivities. Shift  countries should engage in technology- \nand knowledge-transfers, as well as providing access to \nfinance to allow for the reduction of the environmental \nimpacts of the international supply chains they rely \non. Shift countries should focus on circular solution \nnumbers: Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve (see page \n37).\nFrance launches a repairability rating for \nconsumer electronics\nReleased in 2021, the index will be further \nexpanded to include durability criteria in 2024. 226 \nThe rating has received positive public support, \nand is a crucial step in supporting France’s \nobjective to extend product lifetimes, mirroring \nthe US Right to Repair bill and the EU Sustainable \nProducts Initiative . Already, consumers are using \nthe index to aid their purchasing decisions: \naround two-thirds of the shoppers provided with \nthe ratings found it helpful for making choices , \nsuggesting that it could already be having a \npositive impact on consumer behaviour.\n227\nIKEA commits to transforming its entire \nvalue-chain\nIKEA has committed to becoming circular by 2030, \ntaking a holistic approach to transform its entire \nsupply chain while improving working conditions. \nIt aims to use only renewable or recycled \nmaterials in its products: currently, 55.8% of \nthe materials it sources are renewable, while \n17.3% are recycled.  IKEA aims to provide circular \nproduct offerings by giving customers access to \nsolutions and services that keep products in use, \nincluding a care and repair range, buyback and \nresell options, a circular hub, and the opportunity \nto purchase second-hand—with a furniture rental \nservice being explored.\n228 229\n4. DRIVE FORWARD CIRCULAR \nTRANSPORT\nShift  countries have many systemic inefficiencies \nwhen it comes to transport and mobility, such as low \nutilisation and excessive vehicle weight. Although \nexact statistics vary from country to country, generally, \nprivate car ownership and use are very high, as is oil \nuse per capita. In terms of air travel, the richest half of \nthe world (high and upper-middle income countries) is \nresponsible for 90% of aviation emissions.\n230 Circular \nstrategies should focus on avoiding or reducing \nthe need to travel by cutting private vehicle use, \nespecially those with combustion engines, designing \ncar-free cities, and promoting rail over short-haul \nflights. Similarly, switching to more active and energy-\nefficient modes is imperative. This can be incentivised \nby investing in clean, reliable and affordable public \ntransport while incentivising active transport, making \nlightweight shared electric vehicles one of the last \noptions. Shift countries should focus on circular \nsolution numbers: Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen and \nSixteen (see page 39).\nDutch cycling culture emerged in response to \nresource scarcity\nEnabled by safety concerns and an energy crisis \nin the 1970s, the Netherlands abolished major \nurban highway projects, and started prioritising \npolicies that promote safe, healthy and clean \nmobility along with vibrant street life.\n231 In  \nthe Netherlands today, 27% of all trips are  \nmade by bike—and with 17 million inhabitants, \nthe country boasts 23 million bikes . Cycling  \nbenefits both physical and mental health, \nincreases social interaction, allows for  \nresidents to cut transport costs and improves  \nair quality. 232 Recent estimates showed that if \neveryone world-wide cycled as much as the \nDutch, global emissions would drop by 686 \nmillion tonnes of CO\n2 per year.233\nLynk & Co offers a true opportunity for car \nsharing\nWith its flexible mobility memberships, Lynk & \nCo successfully turns mobility into a service. Its \nsubscriptions and car-sharing platform offers a \nmore sustainable alternative to traditional car \nownership. Empowering customers to share  \ntheir cars improves vehicle utilisation and makes \nbetter use of limited urban space. In 2021,  \nLynk & Co delivered 7,500 cars with almost  \n1,000 borrowers and lenders  using the car-\nsharing platform. Among other sustainability \nactions, Lynk & Co dominantly focuses on \nencouraging sustainable car use, creating  \nmobility inclusion, circulating materials and \ndeveloping sustainable and electric cars.\n234\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n55\n54\n\n\nTAKE\nACTION\n5\nThis report has focused on the important role \nthat materials have on two deeply intertwined \nsystems: people and planet. Enacting a global \ncircular economy must be framed within the higher \ngoal of bringing human activity within ecological \nceilings and above social minimums. This analysis \ndemonstrates how circular material management—\ndoing more with less, using longer, and closing the \nloop—is an effective strategy to achieve this goal. \nA global transition to a circular economy means \nthat we could deliver people’s needs with just 70% \nof the current material demand, while bringing \nhuman activity back within the safe limits of the \nplanet. Yet bringing about this systemic change will \nnot only require a deep, large-scale transformation \nof consumption and production patterns, but an \neconomy that is oriented towards new principles \naltogether. This final chapter provides three key \ngoals to rally behind, and clear actions for policy \nmakers and business leaders.\nDelivering a good quality of life to a growing and \ndynamic population while respecting the limits of our \nplanet will require a fundamental transformation of \nhow we use material resources to fulfil needs. This \nreport has identified four global systems where this \ntransformation needs to happen, and has illustrated \n16 bold solutions to deliver that change. But what is \nalso needed is a shared vision that unites us towards \na common purpose. We propose three key priorities \nto guide the implementation of a circular economy \nthat will necessitate bold business strategies and \ninstitutional reform to fulfil the higher goal of  \nwellbeing within boundaries. Without reduction, \nregeneration and redistribution,  the circular economy  \nis just an empty promise.\n235\nREDUCE:  FROM EFFICIENCY TO \nSUFFICIENCY, RESILIENCE AND \nADAPTIVENESS\nThe economy is embedded in nature and \nnature has limits. We must, therefore, \nalso prioritise the efficient transformation \nof materials into societal benefits. This \nmeans that a circular economy must \npush for lifestyles that shift away from \noverconsumption—and towards ones that \ninvest in systems that support human \nthriving while systematically reducing \nwaste and pollution, and use materials more \nefficiently.\nACTIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\nPrioritise wellbeing as a primary indicator \nof economic progress and incorporate \nwellbeing indicators in the policy making \nprocess. Furthermore, countries can establish \nconsumption-based footprint reduction targets \nthat aim to bring production and consumption \nwithin sustainable limits. Countries including \nScotland, New Zealand, Iceland, Wales and \nFinland have begun to adopt wellbeing \nindicators in recent years.\n236 Meanwhile,  \nnational governments can set a baseline for \ntheir material footprint and level of circularity \nusing the Circularity Gap Report methodology, \nand follow Sweden’s example by introducing \nthe first consumption-based carbon footprint \nreduction target.\n237 238\nACTIONS FOR BUSINESS LEADERS\nExplore a wide range of sufficiency-based \nbusiness strategies that expand the value that \nyour business can extend to your customers. \nSuch strategies could include product lifetime \nextension services such as repair, customisation, \nor exchanges for products and services that \nbetter match customer needs. Simultaneously, \ntransform your operations to optimise the \nresource efficiency of your products and \nproduction processes, and expand your  \ncapacity to repair and remanufacture goods  \nthat are already in use.\n239 Follow the example \nof IKEA, which has set an ambitious circularity \ntarget and is working to transform its offerings \nand internal operations.\n240\nNEXT STEPS FOR \nBUSINESSES, \nCITIES AND \nCOUNTRIES\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n57\n56\n\nREGENERATE:  FROM EXTRACTION TO \nREGENERATION\nThe Earth’s regenerative capacity is the \ncornerstone of all forms of life and a gift \nfor human development. Regenerative \nsystems support so many elements of \nhuman life, from nutrition and materials to \nthe production of clean air and water. We \nmust also respect and support its capacity \nto regenerate, by minimising pollution, \nprotecting ecosystems, building soil health \nand strengthening biodiversity, for example. \nMany regenerative solutions already exist \ntoday that give us tremendous hope that we \ncan move humanity from being net-negative \nto net-positive on Earth’s life support system.\nACTIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\nCreate financial incentives based on the \ninclusion of environmental impacts in the  \ncost of goods and services. One well known \nexample is the Ex’tax model, which proposes  \nto shift the tax burden from labour to  \n pollution, waste and natural resource \ndepletion.\n241 242 Governments can systematically \nmeasure and monitor natural capital and \nadjust tax incentives and subsidies to better \nsupport decarbonisation and natural resource \nmanagement, ensuring that the regenerative \ncapacity of its territories and natural assets are \nenhanced, not degraded.\n243 244\nACTIONS FOR BUSINESS LEADERS\nMove away from non-renewable materials  \nand practices that deplete ecosystems,  \nand restructure your business models to \nactively strengthen the regenerative capacity \nof both people and planet. Follow the example \nof Patagonia, which has sourced many of its \nmaterials from regenerative farms while directly \nsupporting, empowering and promoting the \nwork of smallholder farmers.\n245\nREDISTRIBUTE:  FROM ACCUMULATION \nTO DISTRIBUTION\nThere is currently enough wealth and \nmaterials in the world to provide a good \nquality of life to every single human being on \nthis planet.\n246  The challenge is ensuring that \nwe can distribute the access to materials to \nan increasingly expanding group of people, \nrequiring redistribution, different lifestyles, \nbetter technologies and social innovations.\n247 \nBy moving away from ownership and \naccumulation and towards models of access \nthat distribute resources more equally, we \ncan move towards a system that provides \nhigh-quality services to all.\nACTIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\nGovernments can invest in the commons: \nfrom public transport, parks and nature \nreserves, to public housing and renewable \nenergy infrastructure, to healthcare and \nsocial services.\n248 A strong backbone of \npublic infrastructure and services means that \neveryone can have equal access to high-quality \ngoods and services to meet their daily needs. \nGovernments can also steer the transition to                                 \na circular economy by enabling a just transition \nfrom inherently linear industries—like the \nfossil fuel industry—towards inherently circular \nindustries like repair and waste management.\n249 \n250 Practical examples of existing policy tools \nrange from energy taxes to carbon pricing. 251 \nThese should be scaled to accelerate ongoing \nstructural and distributional shifts, mirroring \nexamples such as the use of carbon dividends\n252 \nin Switzerland 253 and Canada. 254\nACTIONS FOR BUSINESS LEADERS\nMove towards service-based business  \nmodels that deliver all the essential services  \nthat customers want. Manage the flow of goods  \nand materials with circular production processes \nsuch as remanufacturing, repurposing and \nrepairing. Leverage digital technologies to \nenable Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) such as \nTagItSmart, which has developed smart tags  \nthat allow manufacturers, consumers and \nrecyclers to track every step of a product’s \nlifecycle, and provides information on how  \nto ensure circularity.\n255\n58\n The Circularity Gap Report  2023\n 59\n\n1.

      "content": "The global economy is now only 7.2% circular; and \nit’s getting worse year on year—driven by rising \nmaterial extraction and use.  The global economy \nincreasingly relies on materials from virgin sources. In \nthe six years of the Circularity Gap Report , the global \neconomy extracted and used more than in the entire \n20th century 1—improving people’s living standards, \nbut at the same time breaking through the safe \nenvironmental limits of the planet. The first edition \nof our Report  in 2018 was the first ever to measure \nglobal circularity, finding it was 9.1%. It dropped to \n8.6% in 2020 and has now fallen to 7.2%. Comparing \nthese figures can be difficult, 2 however, we can assert \nthat circularity goes down as the general rate of global \nmaterial extraction rises. This is coupled with the fact \nthat more and more materials are going into stocks \nsuch as roads, homes and durable goods, thus leaving \nfewer materials to cycle back into the economy. A \ncircular economy focused on cycling alone cannot keep \nup with virgin material use rising to unprecedented \nheights—we cannot recycle our way out of this one.\nWith a circular economy, we can fulfil people’s \nneeds* with just 70% of the materials we currently \nuse—within the safe limits of the planet.  Our \ncurrent economic model is smashing through the \nplanet’s safe limits. Today, five of the nine key \n‘planetary boundaries’ that measure environmental \nhealth across land, sea and air have been broken—\nlargely due to the impacts of the linear ‘take-make-\nwaste’ economy. It is, therefore, critical that we \ntransform our relationship with materials to maximise \nbenefits for people and to minimise the pressure on \nthe planet’s life support systems. Essentially, this  \nstudy finds that adopting a circular economy could  \nnot only reverse the overshoot of planetary \nboundaries, but it could slash the global need for \nmaterial extraction by about one-third. This reduction \nis rooted in removing fossil fuels from the global \nequation—especially coal—and lowering demand for \nhigh volume minerals, such as sand and gravel, largely \nfor housing and infrastructure.\nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\nUse less, use longer, use again and make clean. \nThese four key circular economy principles underpin \nthe solutions presented in this report, highlighting \nhow there is much more to a circular economy than \njust recycling. The 16 circular solutions identified in \nthis report centre on principles that can lead to a \nsharp decline in virgin material extraction (use less) \nand to using the materials that we do have better and \nfor longer (use longer), as well as swapping out fossil \nfuels for renewable energy and toxic materials for \nregenerative ones (make clean). They also boost the \nuse of secondary materials (use again). The circular \neconomy as we present it aims to optimise how \nmaterials are used for the wellbeing of all. It focuses \non circular materials management and minimising \nconsumption towards sufficiency levels—where \nappropriate—to reduce environmental impact.\nCircular solutions for only four global systems \nwill address the lion’s share of environmental \npressures.  This report’s analysis considers the \nimpact of circular materials management on air and \nwater pollution, waste, nature degradation and loss, \nand more—basing our projections on the Planetary \nBoundaries framework. It finds that unleashing just \n16 transformational circular solutions across four \nkey systems—Food systems, the Built environment, \nManufactured goods and consumables, and Mobility \nand transport—can reverse the current overshoot \nof five of the nine key planetary boundaries, thereby \nmaintaining thriving ecosystems for water, land and \nair, and limiting the global temperature rise to within \n2-degrees. Our analysis is unconstrained from political, \neconomic and social dynamics: the findings, therefore, \nserve as an inspiration—providing us with a snapshot \nof what an alternative world could look like.\nEach country has a different starting point and will \nprogress at a different pace towards the shared \nglobal goal of reversing environmental overshoot, \nwhile fulfilling people’s needs. Bringing these \ncircular solutions to life requires an understanding of \nlocal, national and trading contexts. Transformational \nchange does not look the same across the world: \nsome countries need to radically reduce material \nextraction and use, while others need to stabilise or \neven grow it. This study considers these nuances. \nThe world’s highest-income (Shift)  countries deliver \nhigh standards of living, but consume the majority of \nthe world’s materials and massively overshoot many \nplanetary boundaries. These countries must focus on \nreducing overconsumption and lightening their impact \non the environment. Middle-income (Grow) countries \nare rapidly industrialising and have a growing middle \nclass—their material consumption has increased in \ntandem but some are now reaching saturation points. \nThese countries should now focus on new ways to \nstabilise and optimise their material consumption to \nmaximise societal wellbeing. Finally, Build countries \nhouse the majority of the world’s population but use \nless than a tenth of the materials of Shift  countries. \nThese countries should focus on the building up of \ninfrastructure and the provision of wellbeing, even if \nthis requires that they increase their material footprint.\nTo reverse the overshoot and achieve wellbeing \nwithin safe limits, purpose-driven collaboration \nbetween the public and private sectors is \nessential—only then can we scale the transition  \nto a circular economy.  Chapter five highlights the \ncrucial role of public-private collaboration in achieving \nthis bold vision for the future. Circular business models \ncan deliver huge material savings, such as Mobility-as-\na-Service for material-intensive cars that sit unused \nfor 95% of their lifetimes in the Shift  countries. Policy \ncan greatly magnify such business efforts and manage \npotential rebound effects by setting ambitious targets \nfor active mobility in cities, and mandating Extended \nProducer Responsibility. Policy is also crucial to enable \na just transition to a circular economy. There will \ncertainly be several big shifts from linear to circular \nindustries, and potentially rebound effects from \nincreased material efficiency, but policy makers can \nuphold the importance of wellbeing for its citizens  \nand workers. The shift from linear to circular industries \nwill see a seismic shift from business-as-usual, leading \nto rebound effects resulting from increased material \nefficiency. This is why policy makers are essential \nchangemakers in upholding the rights of citizens  \nand workers in the transition. Policy, along with  \nthe entire economic system, needs to shed business-\nas-usual: embracing long-term vision and interests \nover short-term rewards.\nA circular economy offers solutions on how to \nreduce, regenerate and redistribute vital materials \nuse, for both the planet and all its living beings.  \nIn order to achieve the bold ambitions of a circular \neconomy as laid out in this report, we need a shared \nvision. The following three principles can help bring a \nshared focus to business leaders and policy makers:\n• Reduce: from efficiency to sufficiency, \nresilience and adaptiveness.  The economy is \nembedded in nature and nature has limits. We \nmust, therefore, also place boundaries on material \nuse and prioritise the transformation of material \nuse into societal benefits. This means a circular \neconomy must push for a cultural shift to prioritise \nimmaterial ways to fulfil needs, and invest in \nhealth, wellbeing and education and decent jobs, \nrather than material accumulation—as does the \npredominant economic model in many parts  \nof the world.\n• Regenerate: from extraction to regeneration. \nAbout one-quarter of all materials consumed \nby the global economy every year come from \nregenerative sources. The regenerative capacity \nof the planet is a gift—so we must respect and \nsupport its capacity to regenerate, also for future \ngenerations. Many regenerative solutions already \nexist today that show that we can move from \nhumanity being net-negative to net-positive on \nEarth’s life support system. \n• Redistribute: from accumulation to \ndistribution. There is currently enough wealth \nand materials in the world to provide a good \nquality of life to every single human being on \nthis planet. 3 The challenge is ensuring that \nwe can distribute the access to materials to \nan increasingly expanding group of people, \nrequiring redistribution, different lifestyles, better \ntechnologies and social innovations. 4 By moving \naway from ownership and accumulation and \ntowards models of access that distribute resources \nmore equally, we can move towards a system that \nprovides high standards of living to all.\n*The Circularity Gap Report  typically bases its analysis on seven key ‘societal \nneeds and wants’, recognising that materials are increasingly used to fulfil \nmany non-essential ‘wants’. Our analysis does not fully deliberate the \nthreshold point at which a ‘need’ becomes a ’want across all needs and wants.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n9\n8\n",

Many have suffered through \nthe impacts of a global pandemic, droughts, \nwildfires, geopolitical instability and more. Not \none continent was untouched by the dangerous \nimpacts of climate breakdown. The issues that \nwe must collaborate on to solve have long been \nknown—poverty, unsustainable lifestyles, an \neconomic system that prioritises GDP over human \nand planetary wellbeing and more—and the \nurgency is building. Life shouldn’t be determined \nby the cards that you were dealt, but by how you \nplay your hand. Our systems have been wildly \ndegenerative for the past centuries, but why \nshould they continue to be? This report lays out \nsome hard truths about how our linear economic \nmodel has pushed a range of planetary boundaries \nto dangerous and unpredictable limits. But it also \npresents solutions: showing how people’s needs \nand wants—such as nutrition, mobility, housing, \nand basic goods—can be satisfied within crucial \nplanetary boundaries. The key to these solutions \nis circular principles: some so simple that you’d \nwonder why we haven’t always done things this \nway. Others will require radical collaboration \nbetween a variety of actors from industry and \ngovernment and a radical shift in the lifestyles of \nthe world’s wealthiest. But all should inspire us to \ncreate an economy that emulates nature: naturally \ncircular and supporting life. We have a strong hand.\nMATERIALS ARE CENTRAL TO THE STORY \nOF HUMAN PROSPERITY\nMaterials have long propelled human affluence, driving \nrising living standards over the past (at least) 100 \nyears, enhancing life expectancy and employment, \nas well as basic education levels. However, this \nprogress has also come at a tremendous cost: the \nmodern industrial economy is inherently linear—\ncharacterised by ‘take-make-waste’ processes in \npractice. It is also powered by fossil fuels, a finite and \npolluting energy source. Meanwhile, injustice has also \nbecome central to the story of the global economy’s \nrelationship with materials: in many parts of the world, \noverconsumption has effectively become the norm,  \nwhilst elsewhere, minimum living standards are  \nnot even met.\nYET THE LINEAR ECONOMY HAS EXCEEDED \nTHE SAFE AND HEALTHY LIMITS OF THE \nPLANET\nMuch of the environmental impact that has occurred \nin the past 100 years can be attributed to rising \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—and our Circularity \nGap Report 2021 found that 70% of global GHG \nemissions are tied to material handling and use.\n5 \nBut the impacts go far beyond emissions. Ultimately, \nmaterial extraction and use is a strong proxy for \nenvironmental damage\n6—driving over 90% of total \nglobal biodiversity loss and water stress, for example. 7 \nIn fulfilling societal needs—and many wants—we are \nnow transgressing five of nine planetary boundaries \nthat are crucial to planetary health: climate change, \nbiodiversity loss, land system change, chemical \npollution, and cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus. \nOcean acidification—also driven by spiralling carbon \nemissions—is dangerously close to its tipping point. \nClearly, our relationship with materials requires \nbalance. The pursuit of a circular economy—a means \nto the end goal of relieving environmental pressures \nand shaping a thriving society for people—requires \nmore efficient, and sometimes less, material use. Now, \nwe’re consuming and wasting too much, dragging \ndown our global circularity.\nRISING MATERIAL USE DOES DRIVE BETTER \nGLOBAL LIVING STANDARDS—BUT ONLY UP \nTO A POINT\nWhile instrumental to raising living standards, \nresearch shows that after a certain level of material \nconsumption, wellbeing ceases to increase.\n8 9 And \nwe cannot fully blame rising material use on the \nballooning population: in the past 50 years, the global \npopulation has doubled, yet material extraction has \nmore than tripled. Ultimately, the bulk of this has been \nlargely concentrated in wealthy countries (especially \nin a few hotspots, such as North America and Europe), \nand we now see material extraction rising in rapidly \ngrowing middle-income nations ( Grow countries)—\nChina, for example, is thought to be responsible for \n75% of the growth in material consumption since the \nyear 2000.\n10 Affluence, overconsumption and waste \nare the real accelerators of global material demand. \nAnd such affluence has been unequally distributed \nfor far too long: over the past 40 years, for example, \nmore than one-quarter of the new income from global \nGDP growth has gone straight to the world’s richest \nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n13\n12",

The question of how richer nations—\nwhich have largely been responsible for climate-related \ndisasters—can help poorer, more vulnerable nations \nwas front and centre at COP27 in November 2022.\nIS A NEW BLUEPRINT FOR A SUSTAINABLE \nFUTURE FINALLY EMERGING?\nMuch of the world’s coordinated climate action has \nfocused on GHG emission reduction: 196 countries \nsigned the Paris Agreement in 2015, committing \nto limiting average global temperature rise to \n1.5-degrees. However, we’re slowly beginning to see \naction that extends beyond decarbonisation: China’s \nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the \nParis Agreement, for example, details plans to build \nup recycling infrastructure, scale eco-industrial parks \nand ramp up the reuse of organic waste,\n13 while the \nJapanese Government has bold aims to reach ‘full \ncircularity’ by 2050—with a focus on regenerative \nbusiness that helps—rather than hurts—nature.\n14 \nMany other governments have also zoomed in to \nthe local level, co-developing policy roadmaps for \ncircular cities that centre on reducing soaring material \ndemand by better-managing urban spaces and rolling \nout green active transport options—strategies that \nalso tend to improve wellbeing.\n15 As circular solutions \ncontinue to make their way into climate targets around \nthe world, it’s crucial that holistic measures that \nsystemically cut consumption and extend materials’ \nvalue take centre stage along with cycling efforts. \nMeanwhile, transforming economic systems to \nembrace circularity and low-carbon systems will lead \nto job gains as well as losses—as fossil fuels plants are \ndecommissioned in favour of solar and wind farms, for \nexample. Fortunately, research and policy increasingly \nanticipates and addresses the future negative impacts \non workers, industries and regions. Indeed, support \nmeasures, such as reskilling programmes for workers, \nand economic diversification policies for regions, are \ncrucial to a just transition.\nInteresting debates targeting the heart of dominant \nglobal economics have also reached new heights \nthis year: growth at all costs versus green growth \nor degrowth, for example. Meanwhile, countries \nare experimenting with and sharing knowledge \non innovative policy approaches for ‘wellbeing \neconomies’—the Wellbeing Economy Governments \npartnership (WEGo), for example, currently comprises \nNew Zealand, Scotland, Iceland, Wales and Finland.\n16 \nIceland has a range of indicators for wellbeing that \nguide its government in decision making, for example. \nFurthermore, the concept of the Doughnut Economy\n17 \nis being explored in cities such as Amsterdam, \nBrussels, Melbourne, Berlin and Sydney,\n18 and even \nin industries such as the British fashion industry. 19 \nBased on a combination of the Planetary Boundaries \nframework and the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals, the Doughnut aims to reprioritise traditional \neconomics towards the goal of ensuring the needs \nof all are met within the means of the planet.

By upgrading to a model \nthat maximises the value that we extract from \nour precious materials, we can better ensure the \nwellbeing of present and future generations, while \nrespecting the boundaries of our planet.\nTHE CURRENT STATE OF CIRCULARITY  \nWorldwide, total material extraction is on the rise: it \nmore than tripled since 1970, but almost doubled since \nthe year 2000—reaching 100 billion tonnes today. \nThis growth is not solely due to the global population \ndoubling since 1970, as per-person material use has \nonly increased by a factor of 1.7. For instance, while \nvirgin material demand in 1970 was around 7.4 tonnes \nper person, far below today’s approximately 12 \ntonnes,\n24 this growth in per-person material demand \nhas not been evenly distributed across countries. \nMaterial use may outpace population growth in high-\nincome countries, while the opposite is true for lower-\nincome countries—generating a global average that \ndoesn’t show the full picture. Ultimately, the metabolic \nrate of the global economy is accelerating: material \nextraction and consumption are growing at almost \nunprecedented rates, comparable to the  \n‘Great Acceleration’ occuring in the period after the \nSecond World War.\n25 This is revealed by the fact that \nvirgin material use is not set to slow down anytime \nsoon: without urgent action, it is expected to reach  \n190 billion tonnes by 2060.\n26\nHow can a circular economy change this picture? We \nmeasure circularity by looking at what is flowing into \nthe economy. Today, the global economy consumes \n100 billion tonnes of materials, and a portion of that \nconsumption every year comes from secondary \nmaterials. The Circularity Metric, introduced in 2018, \nwas the first approximation of how ‘circular’ the global \neconomy was. In this year’s edition of the Circularity \nGap Report , we present a more holistic view on the \ncircularity of the economy, by looking deeper into the \nlinear consumption that makes up the ‘Circularity Gap’.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n17\n16",

      "content": "CIRCULAR INPUTS\nSecondary materials that are cycled back into the \nglobal economy, otherwise known as circular inputs, \naccount for 7.2%  of all material inputs into the \neconomy—this is the Circularity Metric.\nCircular inputs measure the share of \nsecondary materials that are cycled back \ninto the economy from waste. In just the \npast five years, the world’s circularity has \nshrunk from 9.1% to 7.2% of total material \ninputs. This isn’t simply because we’re failing \nto cycle more—it’s also due to increasing \nvirgin extraction and the fact that we are \nputting more and more materials into stocks \nlike roads, homes and durable goods. This \nmeans that the global economy cannot cycle \nenough to create a truly closed-loop of \nconsumption: without significantly reducing \nmaterial use, it’s inevitable that the \nCircularity Metric will continue to fall.\nRENEWABLE INPUTS  \nThe potential share of renewable materials put into the \neconomy are measured as renewable inputs. These are \ndivided into Ecological cycling potential  (21.2%) —carbon \nneutral biomass—and Non-renewable biomass  (3.8%) —\nbiomass that is not carbon neutral. Together, these \nrepresent approximately 25% of all material inputs.\nBiomass  use has grown by a factor of 2.7 in \nthe past fifty years, now representing about \n27% of total material consumption today, or \n25 billion tonnes per year. Biomass includes \neverything that is harvested from the \nground—from food and feed crops, to \nnatural fibres and timber products. While \nbiomass is largely considered renewable, \nsome is considered non-renewable due to \nthe imbalance in the carbon cycle.\n27 The \nways in which biomass is cultivated is \nprecarious, with land system change often \nlinked to deforestation, soil depletion and \nthe draining of wetlands, which have all \nserved to damage biodiversity while \ndamaging carbon sinks—the latter also \ncausing an increase in emissions.\nWhile carbon neutrality is a necessary condition \nfor biomass to be considered sustainable, it is not \nsufficient in itself: other nutrients such as nitrogen \nand phosphorus should be fully circulated back \ninto the economy or the environment as well. As of \nyet, methodological limitations exist in determining \nnutrient cycling. To this end, in line with past Circularity \nGap Reports , we have excluded ecological cycling in \nour calculation of the global Circularity Metric. For \nexample, we cannot track biomass to its final end-of-\nlife stage, so it isn’t easy to ensure that the nutrient \ncycle has closed. If this were the case, however—and if \nsustainable biomass management were to become the \nnorm—circularity could significantly increase.\nNON-RENEWABLE INPUTS  \nThese materials represent about 15% of total inputs to \nthe global economy and are composed of metals and \nnon-metallic minerals.\nMetal ores  have increased by more than 3.5 \ntimes in fifty years, to 9.4 billion tonnes, \nwhile still representing just one-tenth of \ntotal extraction. This relatively sharp \nincrease is due to the expansion of the built \nenvironment and manufacturing sectors, as \nwell as the transition to clean energy—a \nnecessary but material-intensive process, \nparticularly for metals. The mining of \nmetals, as well as non-metallic minerals, \nhas spurred biodiversity loss, in addition \nto pollution of water, air and soil, and toxic \nwaste generation.\nNon-metallic minerals  have seen the \nsteepest growth: their extraction has \nincreased nearly five times over the last  \n50 years, and now represents almost half  \nof total material extraction, at 42.8 billion \ntonnes. This is primarily due to a booming \nconstruction industry and the need to \nhouse, provide infrastructure and cater  \nfor rising populations in many parts of  \nthe world.\nNON-CIRCULAR INPUTS\nReferring exclusively to fossil fuel energy carriers, \nthese materials represent 14.6%  of total inputs in the \nglobal economy. \nFossil fuels  used for energy consumption \nare highly impactful from an environmental \nperspective and inherently non-circular—\nwhen combusted—as they result in \ndispersed emissions in the atmosphere. \nFossil fuel consumption has grown about 2.6 \ntimes over the last 50 years—and \nrepresents a substantially smaller share of \nthe total: we now consume about 15.5 billion \ntonnes of these materials per year. This is \nlikely due to fossil fuels’ lighter weight \ncompared to heavy materials like minerals. \nHowever, they’re certainly not without \nimpact: the global economy has scaled up \ntheir use to, for example, build and power \nbuildings and industries, transport people \nand goods around the world, produce \nsynthetic fertilisers and manufacture a \nwhole host of basic goods—leading to \nsoaring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nand driving climate change, among other \nenvironmental issues.\nSTOCK BUILD UP\nRepresenting a massive 38% of total material input \ninto the global economy, stock build up is composed of \ncircular, non-renewable and renewable materials—as \ndescribed above—most notably non-metallic minerals \nin the form of construction materials, such as concrete \ngoing into buildings, as well as metal ores such as steel, \naluminium and copper going mainly into buildings, \ninfrastructure, and machinery.\nStocks have grown 23-fold in the 21st \ncentury. This has mainly been in the form of \nlarge, long-lasting structures such as \nbuildings, infrastructure and roads (these \naccount for the largest portion of materials), \nas well as vehicles, machinery, and the \nequipment and appliances we use day-to-\nday. In 2018, approximately 43.6 billion \ntonnes of materials were added to stocks, \nwhile almost 12 billion tonnes were depleted \nfrom stocks in the form of end-of-life waste. \nNet additions to stock thus amounted to \n38.2 billion tonnes. As global material \nextraction and use has surged, a clear \npattern has emerged: almost two-thirds of \nnet stock addition occurs in Grow countries \n(see country profile descriptions on page \n42), while Build  countries contribute to  \nfewer than one-tenth (9%) of total global \nstock additions.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n19\n18\n",

      "content": "THE KEY LEVERS TO \nTRANSITION TOWARDS \nA CIRCULAR ECONOMY\nNow that we have explored the different types of materials that enter the economy every year, we can \nbegin to see where the different principles of circular economy can be applied in our socioeconomic \nmetabolism: we can design stocks  like buildings, infrastructure, machinery and vehicles to be rich \nresource mines for the future, and design manufactured goods and consumables to be cycled  and \nmade regenerative . Furthermore, the focus must also centre on getting more value out of fewer \nmaterials. Achieving the aims of a circular economy—minimising material use, regenerating the  \nEarth and preventing material losses—can be done through four key strategies, based on the work  \nof Bocken et al. (2016):\n1.  NARROW: USE LESS\nNarrow strategies reduce material and energy use. Currently, material use is highly inefficient and \nineffective; we can deliver similar social outcomes by using much less and phasing out fossil fuels, for \nexample. This doesn’t mean being worse off, but rather focussing on using materials efficiently: think \nin terms of riding a bike instead of driving a car, eating less meat and living in a space that suits your \nneeds. Using less is a core tenet of the circular economy—yet currently, the threshold for sustainable \nconsumption, 8 tonnes per person,\n28 is being surpassed by 1.5 times.\n2.  SLOW: USE LONGER\nSlow strategies aim to keep materials in use for as long as possible, for example through design for \ndurability and repairability. A more circular economy is also a slower one: materials, components and \nproducts—and even buildings and infrastructure—that we lock in stocks  are made to last. This will \nlower material demand in the long run, in essence also serving to narrow resource flows.\n3.  REGENERATE: MAKE CLEAN\nRegenerate strategies phase out hazardous or toxic materials and processes, and substitute them \nwith regenerative biomass resources. A circular economy aims to mimic natural cycles—by shifting \nto more regenerative farming practices, for example—while also maximising the share of circular \nbiomass that enters the economy.\n29 Regeneration can happen both at the systems level (by designing \nregenerative processes) as well as at the product level (by switching synthetic to organic fertilisers, \nfor example).\n4.  CYCLE: USE AGAIN\nCycle strategies aim to cycle and reuse materials at their highest value: they maximise the volume \nof secondary materials re-entering the economy, ultimately minimising the need for virgin material \ninputs and therefore also narrowing  flows. Of course, virgin materials will always be needed to a \ndegree: all materials degrade and can’t be cycled infinitely, use energy, and require blending with \nvirgin materials to maintain strength and functionality. \nPRODUCT\nDESIGN\nFUNCTIONAL\nUSE END/hyphen.caseOF/hyphen.caseLIFE\nNARROW\nUSE LESS\nREGENERATE\nMAKE CLEAN\nCYCLE\nUSE AGAIN\nSLOW\nUSE LONGER\nFigure two depicts the four flows to achieve circular objectives: narrow, slow, \nregenerate and cycle.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n23\n22",

      "content": "PRACTICAL CHALLENGES\nIN QUANTIFYING CIRCULARITY\nMeasuring a baseline for global circularity \noffers many advantages, not least that it can \nbe used as a compelling call to action. After \nall, the figures are clear—circularity is in \nreverse. The circular economy, however, is an \nintricate and holistic concept, and representing \nit through one single Metric requires certain \nsimplifications. The limitations stemming from \nthese simplifications are:\nTHERE IS MORE TO CIRCULARITY THAN \n(MASS-BASED) CYCLING\nThe circular economy has multiple aims: keeping \nmaterials in use, at the highest value possible, \nwhile decreasing material extraction and use. Our \nCircularity Metric only measures the mass-based \ncycling of materials that re-enter the economy and \ndoes not consider their composition, value or level \nof quality. Slow  strategies—making things last—and \nnarrow strategies—using less—also aren’t fully \ncaptured. While the introduction of the full Indicator \nFramework (see pages 18–19) is a solid starting \npoint for measuring elements of circularity beyond \ncycling, such as performance in material use, at \nleast for the baseline assessment—the inclusion \nof Net additions to stock is a first step towards \ncapturing slow strategies, for example—there are \nstill limitations. For instance, due to methodological \nchallenges as well as a lack of standardised \nmetrics and data gaps, reflecting such changes \nis not entirely possible—in spite of these loops \nbeing absolutely crucial for obtaining a rounded \nunderstanding of the circular economy.\nACHIEVING 100% CIRCULARITY IS NOT \nFEASIBLE\nWhile our objective may seem to be reaching a ‘fully \ncircular’ economy, this is technically not possible: \nthere’s a practical limit to the volume of materials \nthat can be recirculated. This is partially due to \ntechnical constraints, but also because some \nmaterials are combusted through their use (think \nfossil fuels) while others are locked into long-term \nstocks for many years, making them unavailable for \ncycling. What’s more: materials that can be cycled, \nsuch as metal, plastic and glass, may only be cycled \na few times, as each cycle degrades quality and will \nrequire at least some virgin inputs. The sheer volume \nof materials we use also poses a challenge: it would \ntake a very slow economy to downsize our material \nuse to match our capacity for recycling.\n30 There are \nalso trade-offs to consider: fossil fuels have no place \nin a circular economy, for example, yet the energy \ntransition will be highly material-intensive. In essence, \ndecarbonising the world will cause material extraction \nand consumption to spike—a phenomenon that will \ninevitably drag down the Metric. Our model, which \nanalyses the rate at which circularity could grow, makes \nestimates based on one snapshot in time, rather than a \ndynamic analysis of these future trade-offs.\nA CIRCULAR ECONOMY ISN’T SOCIALLY \nJUST BY DEFAULT\nEnsuring that the circular transition forges a safe space \nin which all people can thrive will require a systems \nredesign: in essence, we need to ensure that we \nminimise the resource use associated with meeting \nhuman needs. Circular strategies can help us achieve \nthis, but the social lens must be taken into account: \ncurrent understandings of the circular economy focus \non material use and do not consider issues of global \nsocial equity, and are threatening to exacerbate the \ndivide between high- and lower-income countries,\n31 as \nwell as within countries. National and supranational \npolicies and commitments in higher-income countries \ncan be short-sighted in practice: often formed to reach \nlocal targets, with no thought of the adverse impact \nthey may have beyond borders, which can include \nexacerbating global power imbalances in lower-income \ncountries, such as exploitative labour practices.\n32\n24\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n25",

Excessive and \nwasteful consumption is outdated—the planet \nis humanity’s life support system and it should \nbe treated as such. The circular economy offers a \ndeep pool of solutions that are key to solving this \nchallenge—using fewer materials where possible \nand squeezing out as much value as possible from \nthe materials we use. Achieving more with less. To \nachieve this, we have developed a series of global \nscenarios that model impacts against the Planetary \nBoundaries framework.\n33 This chapter displays the \nresults of this comprehensive approach: a global \ncircular economy that can reverse the overshoot, \nregenerate systems and achieve wellbeing for \npeople within planetary boundaries. The scenarios \nthat we have developed are designed to explore \nthe ‘what if?’ and provide a glimpse into a world \nwhere we do things differently.\n34 Read on for the \nguide, split between four key systems, based \non the societal needs for housing, nutrition, the \nmanufacturing of basic goods, and mobility.\nMAPPING PLANETARY HEALTH: A COMPLEX \nAND INTERRELATED PICTURE\nThis analysis relies on the Planetary Boundaries \nframework to provide a holistic and in-depth \nunderstanding of planetary health. The framework was \nconceived in 2009 by Johan Rockström, former director \nof the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm \nUniversity, together with 28 world-renowned scientists, \nto identify the processes that regulate the stability and \nresilience of the Earth’s systems. They proposed nine \nquantifiable and interrelated planetary boundaries \nwithin which humanity can safely continue to thrive: \ncrossing these boundaries increases the risk of causing \nirreversible environmental changes, threatening \nhuman life on Earth.\n35 Today, five of the nine planetary \nboundaries have been crossed, 36 and we are now \nfunctioning beyond a sustainable operating space \nand are in the ‘danger zone’ of irreversible change to \nEarth’s natural life-supporting system.\n37\nAN APPROACH BASED ON PEOPLE’S \nNEEDS—AND SOME WANTS\nCertain actions of the linear economy, from its \nthrowaway culture to its heavy use of fossil fuels, lead \nto huge rises in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \ncontributing to climate change. But ‘climate change’ is \nonly one of the nine boundaries. These boundaries laid \nout in the framework indicate different—but inherently \ninterrelated—components of planetary health\n48 that \ncurrent human activities cross in many different \nways (see page 29). If managed correctly, the circular \neconomy is a means to address the root causes of \neach of the planetary boundaries—truly allowing this \ngeneration to reverse the overshoot era. But how?\nOur Circularity Gap Reports have always grounded \ntheir perspectives through the seven societal \nneeds and wants: materials have a vital role to play \nin fulfilling people’s needs for housing, nutrition, \nmobility, manufacturing, healthcare, education and \ncommunication. A circular economy approach allows \nus to change the way we meet these needs. Consider \nthe need for mobility, which transports people \nfrom their homes to workplaces, friends and family. \nPrivate passenger vehicles require large volumes of \nmaterials and fuel to operate, spend nearly 95% of \ntheir lifetime parked and place heavy demands on \nroad infrastructure—and yet often only carry one \nor two people at a time.\n49 Taking a more circular \napproach, where public transport, car sharing and \nmore active modes like cycling are prioritised, can \ndramatically reduce both material use and pressure on \ninfrastructure. In essence: serving the same need, but \nwith far less impact.\nThis report examines how four of these key needs \nand wants—nutrition, housing, mobility and \nmanufacturing—connect to the Planetary Boundaries \nframework, finding that they contribute to the vast \nmajority of overshoot. In these areas of the economy, \nfeedback loops run wild: consider agriculture, for \nexample, where excessive fertiliser use intended to \nmaximise output harms soil health and biodiversity, \nwhich cuts yields, pushing us into even higher fertiliser \nuse. Through circular strategies, we can reverse this: If \nwe fundamentally reshape how we provide for needs \nby using less, using longer, using again and making \nclean, we can shrink our impact and land firmly back in \na safe operating space.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n27\n26",

The result? A set of 16 circular solutions \nhave been modelled across four global systems:  \nFood systems, the Built environment, Manufactured \ngoods and consumables, and Mobility and transport. \nThe counterfactual scenarios that have been \ndeveloped in this report are designed to explore \n‘what if?’ and do not take into account the effects of \ntransitions over time, such as the changes in resource \nextraction in the transition to renewable energy.  \nEach of the solutions that have been modelled  \nare summarised on pages 33, 35, 37 and 39. \nFOOD SYSTEM\nThe full set of farm-to-fork-to-bin activities \nalong the agrifood value chain, involving \nthe production, processing, transport, \nconsumption and disposal of food.\n50 51 We \ndo not consider activities upstream from \nagriculture, such as fertiliser or machinery \nproduction for farms.\nMANUFACTURED GOODS AND \nCONSUMABLES\nA collection of production and consumption \nactivities related to durable manufactured \ngoods (such as machinery, equipment, \nvehicles and furniture) as well as \nconsumables (such as textiles, fast-moving \nconsumer goods and electronics). \nFor a more detailed description of the entire modelling \nexercise, please refer to the methodology document \naccompanying this report.*\nThe circular economy solutions belonging to each \nsystem typically only contribute a minor impact \nreduction across the planetary boundaries. But when \nwe combine them, we can see the substantial impact \nthat a circular economy can have at a global level.\n*Find the full methodology document at  \ncircularity-gap.world/methodology\nFreshwater consumption\nThis is measured in terms of ‘blue’ and ‘green’ water. \nBlue water is the freshwater held in surface reservoirs. \nGreen water is the fraction of rainfall that is absorbed \nby soil to feed plants. The freshwater cycle is closely \nlinked to climate change and its boundary mirrors that \nof the climate boundary. A water boundary related \nto consumptive freshwater use and environmental \nflow requirements has been proposed to maintain the \noverall resilience of the Earth system.\n44\nLand system change\nThis is driven primarily by agricultural expansion \nand intensification. Humanity may be reaching a \npoint where further agricultural land expansion at \na global scale may seriously threaten biodiversity \nand undermine the regulatory capacities of the \nEarth system. The Planetary Boundaries framework \nproposes that no more than 15% of global usable land \nshould be converted to cropland.\n45\nBiogeochemical flows: cycles of nitrogen and \nphosphorus\nNitrogen and phosphorus are both essential elements \nfor plant growth, but activities like agriculture, poor \nwastewater management and fossil fuel use convert \nmore atmospheric nitrogen into reactive forms than  \nall of the Earth’s terrestrial processes combined.  \nA significant fraction of these nutrients make their  \nway to the sea, and can push marine and aquatic \nsystems across ecological thresholds of their own,\n46 \nwhile impacting human health.\nAtmospheric aerosol loading\nThis is impacted by GHG emissions and land-use \nchange that releases dust and smoke into the air.  \nShifts in climate patterns and monsoon systems  \nhave already been seen in highly polluted \nenvironments, giving a quantifiable regional  \nmeasure for an aerosol boundary.\n47\nStratospheric ozone depletion\nThis means higher levels of UV radiation reach ground \nlevel. The appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole was \nproof that increased levels of man-made ozone-depleting \nchemical substances, interacting with polar stratospheric \nclouds, had passed a threshold. Fortunately, because \nof the actions taken as a result of the 1989 Montreal \nProtocol, we appear to be back on track to staying within \nthis boundary.\n38\nBiodiversity loss\nLoss of biosphere integrity results in the loss of local \nand regional biodiversity, which makes ecosystems \nmore vulnerable to changes in climate and ocean acidity. \nCurrently, the extinction rate is used as a boundary \nmeasure for loss of biosphere integrity. Today, the global \nextinction rate far exceeds the rate of speciation.\n39 If the \ncurrent extinction rate is sustained, an undesired system \nchange is highly likely.\nChemical pollution and release of novel \nentities\nThis includes microplastics, pesticides, heavy metal \ncompounds and radioactive materials. Persistent organic \npollution, for example, has caused dramatic reductions \nin bird populations and impaired reproduction and \ndevelopment in marine mammals.\n40\nClimate change\nThis is measured by CO 2 concentration in the \natmosphere, with a suggested boundary of 350 parts  \nper million (ppm) above the pre-industrial level. 41 We’ve \nnow surpassed 390 ppm CO 2 in the atmosphere. The loss \nof summer polar sea-ice is almost certainly irreversible. \nThis is one example of a well-defined threshold that, \nwhen breached, gravely impacts the Earth system.\n42\nOcean acidification\nThis is a reduction in the ocean’s PH due to CO 2 \nabsorption: around one-quarter of our CO 2 emissions \ndissolve in the ocean. 43 This makes it difficult for \nessential marine life to survive. Unlike most other  \nhuman impacts on the marine environment, which \nare often local in scale, this boundary has global \nramifications. It is also an example of how tightly \ninterconnected the boundaries are, as atmospheric  \nCO\n2 concentration is the underlying variable for both  \nthe climate change and ocean acidification boundaries.\nSafe Close to  \novershooting\nLegend\nOvershot\nTHE PLANETARY BOUNDARIES FRAMEWORK\nFOUR KEY SYSTEMS TO REVERSE \nTHE OVERSHOOT\nBUILT ENVIRONMENT\nThe construction, use and maintenance of \ncommon, man-made physical structures. \nThese include residential and commercial \nbuildings, as well as infrastructure such as \nroads, bridges and dams.\nMOBILITY AND TRANSPORT\nAll of the activities (including fuels and \nvehicles) involved in moving goods and \npeople from point A to B over land,  \nwater and air. \nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n29\n28\n",

      "content": "TRANSFORM THE  GLOBAL \nFOOD SYSTEM1\nThe need to sustainably fulfil the nutritional needs \nof around 10 billion people by 2050 is no small \nfeat.\n55 56  As global incomes also rise, so does food \ndemand and production—and waste, if business-as-\nusual continues. And more often than not, where \nincomes rise consumers spend their extra money \non meat: meat consumption has more than doubled \nsince 1990.\n57 Ultimately, future food demand could \nincrease by 35 to 56% by 2050. 58\nHowever, food production cannot keep expanding \nindefinitely: it is the single largest driver of ecological \nimpact and transgression of planetary boundaries.\n59 \nWhile all food production comes with environmental \ncosts, the bulk of these are partly due to the huge \nswathes of land dedicated to industrially  growing what \nwe—or livestock—eat: agricultural activities now occupy \nroughly half of the habitable surface of the planet \nand industrial practices decimate biodiversity, soil \nhealth and more. Livestock production is particularly \nimpactful.\n60 61 For example, it occupies around two-\nfifths of the planet’s usable land surface. Fishing and \naquaculture also generate significant environmental \nimpacts on marine and freshwater ecosystems, water \nuse and quality, and biodiversity loss, through activities \nsuch as overfishing, trawling, and chemical and plastic \npollution, for example.\n62 63 Further, huge amounts of \nconsumer-ready food is wasted, marking a huge loss \nof not only nutritional resources but also energy, \nlabour and land. Waste occurs both at the farm—14% \nof the world’s food waste occurs during post-harvest \nproduction and processing phases\n64 —and at the \nconsumer end. Often, current food practices focus on \nmaximising food production, rather than delivering \nhealthy and nutrient-dense food—there are not only \nenvironmental, but also health costs to business-as-\nusual. Overall, food production practices are highly \nimpactful on planetary boundaries:\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS BY FAR THE LARGEST \nDRIVER OF LAND-USE CHANGE GLOBALLY\n65\nIn terms of land footprint, agriculture is by far the most \nimpactful: around 7% of global land use is allocated to \ncrops,\n66 which is equivalent to the size of East Asia, and \nlivestock production alone occupies over one-quarter \n(27%) of global land use, equivalent to the size of the \nAmericas.\n67 The production of lost and wasted food \nglobally accounts for 23% of global cropland. 68\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS A MAJOR DRIVER \nOF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OCEAN \nACIDIFICATION\nIt makes up one-third of GHG emissions,\n69 while animal \nhusbandry alone is linked to about 14.5% of global \nGHG emissions. 70 The production of lost and wasted \nfood globally accounts for between 8 and 10% of global \nGHG emissions.\n71\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE \nFOR 70% OF THE GLOBAL ACCESSIBLE \nFRESHWATER WITHDRAWALS THROUGH \nIRRIGATION\n72\nGlobally, water demand from agriculture has more \nthan doubled between 1960 and 2000.\n73 Food waste \nalone is responsible for 24% of total freshwater \nresources used in food production.\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM CONTRIBUTES TO THE \nVAST MAJORITY OF NUTRIENT OVERLOAD\nExcessive use of synthetic fertilisers has resulted in an \noverload of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. \nLivestock production alone is responsible for about \none-third of global nitrogen mobilisation, enough \nto meet the entire ‘planetary budget’ for nutrient \noverload.\n74 The production of lost and wasted food \nglobally accounts for 23% of global fertiliser use. 75\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM IS THE SINGLE LARGEST \nDRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n76\nHuman land use change for food production results \nin habitat loss and fragmentation, driving biodiversity \nloss and soil degradation.\n77 78\nCIRCULAR SOLUTIONS \nFOR THE FOOD SYSTEM\nThe unique properties of the global food trade and \nthe importance of food as a basic human need—and \nright—necessitate a systemic approach to sustainable \nfood production and consumption for a planet of 8 \nbillion people. This modelled scenario shows that \nglobal food production can be done in a circular \nmanner; it is not necessary to sacrifice crop yields to \nreduce environmental impacts\n79 if food systems are \ndesigned on closed nutrient cycling, water-nutrient \nmanagement is improved, and symbiosis is ingrained \nwithin and between systems that are regenerative. \nChanging food consumption is also key: reducing \nhigh-impact foods, such as meat, as well as excessive \ncaloric intake, and cutting food waste across the value \nchain (but particularly at the post consumer stage) are \nfundamental if the global food system is to remain \nwithin planetary boundaries.\n80 81 According to our \nanalysis, applying these four circular solutions to this \nsystem could help reverse the global overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries:\n1. PUT HEALTHIER, SATIATING FOODS \nFIRST\nHealthy daily calorie intakes are averaged \nat around 2,600.\n82 Prioritise satiating and \nhealthy foods with a lower environmental \nimpact—ideally shifting calories from \nmeat, fish and dairy towards cereals, fruits, \nvegetables and nuts.\n2. GO LOCAL, SEASONAL AND \nORGANIC\nPrioritise the production and consumption of \nlocal, seasonal and organic produce, which  \ncan lead to a reduced need for fertiliser, \nheating fuels, and transportation and \nprocessing services.\n4. NO MORE AVOIDABLE FOOD \nWASTE\nAbolish food waste along the supply chain \nand at the consumer level through better \nmanagement of transport and storage, \nmore refrigeration and smart planning, and \ntechnology at the consumer and food  \nservice levels.\n3. MAINSTREAM REGENERATIVE \nAGRICULTURE\nScale up regenerative and circular agricultural \nprocesses that encourage closed nutrient \nloops. This model supports healthy soils \nand ultimately keeps the land arable for far \nlonger than typical farming processes.

      "content": "BUILD A CIRCULAR \nBUILT ENVIRONMENT2\nHousing and providing services for the world’s \nrapidly urbanising population—especially in \nBuild and Grow countries—will inevitably require \nadditional material use. Yet crucial construction \nmaterials are already becoming scarce due to \noveruse and rising incomes have shaped an \nappetite for bigger homes and ultimately more \nspace—also driven by a rising trend for living \nalone in Shift countries. 83 The quick build-up of \ncities without smart urban planning has also \ncontributed to urban sprawl, leading to high car \ndependency, air and noise pollution and excessive \nmaterial use. 84 But it’s not only about the material \nuse involved in the construction of buildings: the \nway in which these are built will substantially \ninfluence material demand during their use phase, \nfrom energy efficiency to the lifetime extension \nof buildings themselves. Today, due to a lack of \ncircular design and integrated planning, buildings \nalready in use are major carbon emitters, claiming \nnearly one-third of global energy consumption. 85\nOur need for buildings and infrastructure is one of \nthe most impactful: worldwide, construction and \ndemolition drives nearly one-third of total material \nconsumption, and generates a similar portion of \nwaste. 86 Particularly over the past two decades, \nsoaring demand from the construction industry  \nhas caused the extraction of non-metallic minerals—\nespecially sand and gravel—to triple, 87 with sand \nbeing taken from the Earth more quickly than it can \nbe replenished. 88 After clean water, sand is the world’s \nmost used resource. The (often unregulated) mining \nof these materials, production and transport of \nconstruction materials, and building operations and \nend-of-life waste management of the construction \nand demolition phase drive a range of climate-related \ndisasters and planetary boundary impacts:\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS RESPONSIBLE \nFOR ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF LAND \nSYSTEM CHANGE\nHowever, the built environment (including villages, \ntowns, cities and infrastructure) is estimated to occupy \njust 1% of global land surface, or about 60 million \nhectares. 89 Through the extraction of the minerals \nnecessary to produce construction materials and the \nemissions it generates, it is responsible for habitat \ndestruction and consequently, biodiversity loss. 90 91 92\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS A MAJOR \nDRIVER OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OCEAN \nACIDIFICATION\nApproximately 40% of global GHG emissions can \nbe attributed to buildings’ construction, use and \ndemolition. Upstream activities, such as the production \nof building materials, are energy-intensive processes \nthat generate vast amounts of GHG emissions: cement \nproduction alone contributes around 7% of global \nCO2 emissions. 93 Buildings are also major energy \nconsumers and thus emitters: building operations are \nresponsible for approximately 55% of global electricity \nconsumption, for example. 94\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT DRIVES WATER \nSTRESS\nSand and gravel extraction disrupt water supplies, \nhydrological functions and river and coastal \necosystems. 95 The production of construction  \nmaterials such as cement, steel and glass are  \nwater-intensive processes. 96 97\nThe built environment is essential, yet the way we \ndesign our built-up spaces to deliver these needs \ndetermines the material demand to follow—thereby \neither greatly impacting or benefiting the environment. \nWith circular economy design principles at the core,  \nthe circular solutions identified in this report show \nthat we can create a modern and efficient built \nenvironment with significantly less impact on the \ncrucial life support systems of the planet. According to \nour analysis, applying these four circular solutions to \nthis system could help reverse the global overshoot  \nof planetary boundaries:\n5. BE AS ENERGY EFFICIENT AS \nPOSSIBLE\nFrom the design phase, utilise circular \nstrategies to create material- and energy-\nefficient buildings, through the ‘passivhaus’ \napproach, for example. Couple these designs \nwith a roll out of clean energy solutions: for \nexample, low-carbon heating and cooling \napproaches such as heat pumps. Prioritise \nenergy efficient appliances, wash at lower \ntemperatures and lower thermostat settings \nby a few degrees. Overall, radically reduce \nenergy and material demands.\n6. MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT \nALREADY EXISTS\nThere are already huge amounts of materials \nlocked into existing buildings—make the \nmost of them by reusing, repurposing and \nrenovating with secondary materials. Where \nnew builds are needed, be as efficient as \npossible with urban planning solutions that \nfollow circular design principles so that \nbuildings can be reused, repurposed or easily \ndisassembled in the future.\n7. PRIORITISE CIRCULAR MATERIALS \nAND APPROACHES\nA huge range of circular approaches can \ncut the emissions and material intensity of \nbuildings. Transition to using wood, timber or \ncross-laminated timber instead of steel and \nconcrete, or move to other locally available \nmaterials. Utilise mainstream modular \nconstruction and prioritise lightweight frames \nand structures to reduce cement and steel \nuse, as well as green roofs where possible.\n8. REUSE WASTE\nMaximise the high-value reuse of buildings \nand components where possible. Ideally, \nmake construction and demolition waste \na thing of the past, but where it cannot be \navoided: ensure that as much of it as possible \nis recycled to avoid the need for virgin \nmaterials, such as sand and gravel.\nCIRCULAR SOLUTIONS \nFOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n35\n34\n",

      "content": "ACHIEVE CIRCULAR \nMANUFACTURED GOODS \nAND CONSUMABLES3\nHeavy industry and manufacturing kick-started \nthe Anthropocene: our current geological epoch, \nin which human activity is the main driver of Earth \nsystem changes. The impacts of the industrial \nsystem stem from two main factors: the scale of \nproduction (and consumption), and production \nprocesses themselves. The mechanisation of \nproduction—occurring during the Industrial \nRevolution—was and continues to be tightly linked \nwith high energy use, particularly fossil fuels. It \nalso enabled mass consumption, as consumption \nis both the driver and goal of the expansion of \nproduction. Therefore, the environmental impacts \nof industrial activities occur across the entire \nlifecycle: from material extraction to processing and \nend-of-life. Mining of the metals that are crucial for \nmanufacturing has spurred serious environmental \nand social consequences. Mining processes create \nvast quantities of waste rock and toxic waste.\n98 \nIndustrial production processes are similarly \nimportant—since they determine system efficiency \nand thus influence energy and material use—and \nimpactful: this analysis estimates that over one-\nquarter (28% or 9.8 billion tonnes) of global solid \nwaste generation is industrial waste. Similarly, \nwhile industrial activities are highly energy-\nintensive (often fossil fuels), much of industry’s vast \nenergy consumption is lost as waste heat.\n99\nThe entire lifecycle of other product streams such \nas steel (and other metals), paper and cardboard, \nchemicals, textiles manufacturing, and plastics \nproduction are also highly impactful. The production of \nsteel and other metals is highly energy- and material-\nintensive, representing around 10% of global primary \nenergy demand,\n100 and thus represents a significant \namount of the share of the environmental footprint \nof industrial systems.\n101 Similarly, textiles production \nand consumption has exploded during the last two \ndecades: with production doubling between the years \n2000 and 2014, and the average consumer buying \nmany more pieces, yet each clothing item now being \nkept half as long.\n102 This makes textiles responsible for \nsubstantial environmental impacts, including a hefty \ncarbon footprint (up to 10% of GHG emissions\n103), \nchemical pollution, and waste generation. 104 Plastics \nare ubiquitous in modern society but they are also \nespecially problematic: production has doubled since \nthe year 2000, and waste and pollution are growing \nrelentlessly,\n105 with highly impactful environmental \nconsequences on land and sea as well as with dire \nsocial consequences attached.\n106 107 Some of this \nsystem’s planetary boundary impacts include:\nTHE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE \nFOR LAND-SYSTEMS CHANGE\nAs heavy, material- and energy-intensive industrial \nactivities that primarily consume metals and fossil \nfuels, manufacturing is linked to deforestation and \nland use change,\n108 109 110 111 particularly in the tropics, 112 \ndirectly impacting ecosystem destruction 113 and \nbiodiversity loss. 114\nTHE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM ACCOUNTS FOR \nAPPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF GLOBAL \nGHG EMISSIONS\n115\nBecause around three-quarters of its processes’ \nenergy demands are met by coal, steel production \nalone generates more emissions than all road freight,\n116 \nfor example. 117\nTHE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM DRIVES \nCHEMICAL POLLUTION OVERSHOOT AND \nTHE RELEASE OF NOVEL ENTITIES\n118\nIncreased production and release of chemicals and \nplastics pollution present a wide range of adverse \nenvironmental impacts and on (other) biophysical \nprocesses, including water stress,\n119 120 soil health and \nbiosphere integrity, among others. 121\nThe manufacturing industry is rife with opportunity to \ndo better by drawing on circular strategies that boost \nefficiency, get more from less, minimise pollution \nand consider social justice measures. Extractive and \nmanufacturing industries will need to continue into the \nfuture to fuel our collective demand for materials and \nto support the large-scale deployment of renewable \nenergy infrastructure. It is critical that, in addition to \nthe adoption of sustainable practices, individual  \nand community livelihoods are protected well into  \nthe future. Curbing material demand will be crucial  \nto decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors—iron, steel and \naluminium manufacturing, for example. According to \nour analysis, applying these four circular solutions to \nthis system could help reverse the global overshoot  \nof planetary boundaries:\n9. MAINSTREAM INDUSTRIAL \nSYMBIOSIS AND EFFICIENCY\nAchieve process improvements, scrap \ndiversion and reduction in yield losses \nthrough greater industrial symbiosis and \nefficiency. Foster tighter collaboration within \nand between industries to deliver powerful \nmaterial and emissions savings.\n10. EXTEND THE LIFETIME OF \nMACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND \nGOODS\nMaximising the lifetime of goods that  \nserve our daily needs can bring a number of \nenvironmental benefits. Decrease the costs \nto repair, remanufacture, upgrade and reuse \nthrough circular business models, material \nsubstitution, or regulations on the minimum  \nguarantee of products.\n11. BUY WHAT YOU NEED\nReduce the purchases of common electronic \ngoods, appliances and other equipment to \nsufficiency levels. This shift is assumed to be \nsupported by a combination of policies such \nas a raw material tax, but also service-based \ncircular business models like sharing  \nor pay-per-use. \n12.

These impacts aren’t set to reverse: the \ndemand for transport is trending strongly upwards \nall around the world,\n122 and left unchecked, \nemissions from the transport system could grow by \n60% by 2050.\n123\nTransport is the single largest driver of oil demand \nworldwide, claiming around 60% of the total, and \naccounting for nearly one-third of final energy use.\n124 \nOur oil and transport dependence is causing emissions \nto spiral. Passenger cars are the most common vehicle, \nand because most of them are powered with internal \ncombustion engines, they are the largest source of \nemissions.\n125 The number of vehicles worldwide has \nincreased significantly during the last two decades, \nparticularly passenger cars.\n126 Similarly, aviation, \ndespite representing a relatively smaller share of \nemissions for transport compared to road transport, \nis the fastest growing source of emissions within the \nsystem.\n127 However, inequality within and between \ncountries is vast. For example, the richest half of the \nworld (high- and upper-middle income countries) \nare responsible for 90% of air travel emissions, while \nlower-middle income countries emit just 1%.\n128 But \ntransport and mobility networks, including not only the \nvehicles but the physical infrastructure that underpins \nthem, generate significant environmental pressures. \nThe bottom line: our need for transport—and our \nlargely linear way of meeting this need—leads to:\nTHE TRANSPORT SYSTEM IS A MAJOR \nDRIVER OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OCEAN \nACIDIFICATION, ACCOUNTING FOR \nAPPROXIMATELY 25% OF GHG EMISSIONS \nGLOBALLY\nRoad transport and air travel concentrate the bulk of \nemissions from the transport system: around 85% of \nthe total.\n129 Mainly—although not only—due to its high \ncarbon footprint, transport and mobility are also major \ndrivers of ocean acidification.\n130\nTHE TRANSPORT SYSTEM DRIVES LAND \nUSE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS\nFor example, the development of land-based \ntransportation infrastructure, particularly the \nconstruction and expansion of major road corridors, \noften leads to deforestation, landscape alteration, and \nbiodiversity loss.\n131 132 133 Transport, a core component \nof international trade, has also been found to increase \ndeforestation.\n134 Still, shipping and cruises that release \nharmful pollutants into the water lead to marine litter \nthat severely impacts biodiversity.\n135\nTransiting transport and mobility towards \nsustainability is a multidimensional process, and \nkey to reducing environmental pressures globally.\n136 \nIt’s crucial for emissions from transport and \nmobility to decrease sharply in the coming years, \nthrough decarbonisation and the higher uptake of \nactive transport modes: walking and biking, where \npossible.

This chapter builds on the country profiles \nintroduced in the Circularity Gap Report 2020 , which \nallow us to prioritise circular solutions based on \ncountries’ performance on human development \nand ecological impact.\n137 Whilst recognising that \nno single country can ever be a perfect match for \nall the criteria of any one profile, it is important \nto present a wide range of circular solutions that \ncan be adapted to optimise wellbeing within \nthe country context, by combining technology, \nbusiness and policy.\nMYTH-BUSTING: POPULATION GROWTH \nDOES NOT LEAD TO OVERSHOOT\nThe previous chapter demonstrated the disconnect \nbetween human activity and the planet upon which \nwe rely to live. As the global population grows \nand incomes rise—importantly lifting many out of \npoverty—consumption also rises. But increasing \nconsumption beyond a point results in diminishing \nreturns for wellbeing, and is detrimental to the \nplanet, which further impacts the wellbeing of future \ngenerations. We need to think critically about how to \nstrike a balance for the planet and all of its people, \nwhich urges us to redefine progress and look beyond \nonly short-term impacts. As many have pointed \nout before, our current measuring stick of GDP for \nprogress isn’t always effective—it’s sometimes even \ncounterintuitive. The destruction of natural carbon \nsinks that are home to thousands of species is a good \nmove for short-term economic growth, but not the  \nenvironment, for example.\nOur analysis locates numerous national examples \nwhere a spike in material use has been to the \ndetriment of wellbeing indicators, such as life \nexpectancy, nutrition, democratic quality, equality, \neducation, access to energy and social support, \namong others. Singapore and Lithuania had the \nlargest material footprint increase of the 148 countries \nstudied\n138 in the period 2005 to 2015, yet Lithuania \nrecorded no average growth across wellbeing \nindicators (a small increase in life expectancy was \ncompensated by a small decrease in life satisfaction) \nand Singapore achieved only a very small average \nincrease (mostly by increasing employment). This \nstarkly contrasts countries such as Angola, Eswatini, \nTogo, Nepal, The Gambia and South Africa, which \nmarked strong progress on several wellbeing \nindicators yet had stable, and even declining,  \nmaterial footprints. This indicates that to better  \nalign increasingly scarce and competed for materials \nwith the essential needs of people, additional  \nmaterials should be directed towards countries \nwhere material scarcity hampers progress on basic \nwellbeing—rather than countries whose material \nneeds are more than satisfied.\nTo this end, this report takes a similar approach. While \nit finds that circular solutions across key systems can \ncut global material demand by about one-third (34%) \nand reverse the overshoot, it is important to note that \nthis reduction should not be equally shouldered across \ncountries. Shift  countries are responsible for most of \nthe overshoot, and often carry a material footprint that \nis double or even triple the global average.\n139\nBUILD, GROW, SHIFT: THREE COUNTRY \nPROFILES\nDespite clear divergences between countries, we can \nstill discern which circular economy interventions \nwill be most suitable in certain contexts based on \nclear common needs and structural parallels. In our \n2020 analysis, we took 176 countries and scored \nthem on their social performance (measured by a \nHuman Development Index score) and their ecological \nfootprint\n140 to assess how far they were from the \nend goal: a socially just and ecologically safe space. \nOur overarching finding was illuminating: no country \nresides within a safe and just space today. Some \ncountries are close, others are far away; each starts \nfrom a different point on the map, but all have a \ndistance to go. The position of each country in this \nanalysis helps us form the three broad country \nprofiles, which may exhibit some overlaps but overall \nallow us to highlight key common themes that are \ncentral to development pathways.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n41\n40",

TRANSFORM THE  \nFOOD SYSTEM\nBuild nations have predominantly agrarian, biomass-\nbased economies where agriculture is central to \nthe economy. Our analysis finds that over half of \ntotal material input to these economies is made \nup of biomass, and the vast majority of all waste \ngenerated is agricultural. Agriculture also makes up \nalmost 60% of the total workforce, thereby holding an \nenormous potential to improve livelihoods.\n141 The vast \nmajority of farmers own small-scale operations or are \npastoralists who depend on the food they can produce \non their own. Malnutrition and poverty are key social \nchallenges, largely due to poor soil conditions, climatic \nrisks and lacking supply chain infrastructure.\n142 \nOne of the key challenges for Build countries is to \nfoster adaptive and regenerative food systems that \nbuild ecosystem health, and yield multiple sources \nof income for producers, while ensuring scalable \ninfrastructure is in place to secure food supply to \nsurrounding populations. Circular economy solutions \ncan be strengthened by combining material-smart \ntechnologies with regenerative and adaptive principles \nfor agricultural production, as well as taking into \naccount low-tech, human-centred designs that are \ncompatible with low material use and community \npreferences. Build countries should focus on circular \nsolution numbers: One, Two and Four (see page 33).\nOne-acre farm is a highly profitable, mixed \nfarm near Lake Victoria in Uganda\nBy reinforcing regenerative processes, the  \nfarm generates multiple revenue streams  \nestimated at €95,000 per year —more than  \nten times the average Ugandan salary.  \nBeneficial exchanges of materials take place \nfarm-wide: nothing goes to waste—maggots, \nfor example, are grown on pig waste to feed to \nchicken and fish. The farm requires 80% less  \nfeed and input costs, and produces multiple  \ncrops and by-products such as biogas.\n143 \nRegenerative agriculture offers a powerful  \nlever to boost local employment,  while  \ncritically improving soil quality and  \necosystem services, which protect the  \nlivelihoods of future generations.\nColdHubs offers affordable subscription \nmodels that can boost access to cold chain \nsolutions\nTo ensure that regenerative agricultural products \nreach consumers, adequate distribution \ninfrastructure is needed: ColdHubs is a post-\nharvest, solar-powered, Cooling-as-Service \nsolution in Nigeria. The 24 operational ColdHubs \nsaved 20,400 tonnes of food from spoilage, \nincreased the household income of over 3,500 \nsmallholders, retailers and wholesalers by 50%, \ncreated 48 new jobs for women and mitigated \n462 tonnes of CO\n2 emissions , with an annual \nenergy consumption reduction of 547 kilowatt-\nhours. ColdHubs offers farmers a flexible pay-as-\nyou-store subscription model at rates that they \ncan afford, helping to tackle the barrier of access \nto financing for cold chain solutions.\n144\n2. BUILD A CIRCULAR BUILT \nENVIRONMENT\nBuild nations have fast growing and urbanising \npopulations largely living in informal settlements with \nlimited access to basic services. The majority of the \n1.6 billion people that live without adequate shelter \nworldwide\n145 live in Build nations.146 This has ripple \neffects across the built environment: a lack of access \nto public transport, mounting waste and poor waste \nmanagement, and increased air pollution.\n147 At the \nsame time, many Build nations house rich ecosystems, \nyet high levels of extraction of sand, gravel and \nlimestone, and iron ores for use in the construction \nindustry have majorly impacted the landscape and \nspurred biodiversity loss.\n148 149 For example, in The \nGambia, 20% of all material use relates to construction, \nand over 50% of construction materials stem from \nnon-renewable sources. The import of construction \nmaterials and metals constitute 24% of imported \nembodied carbon. Next to this, the extraction of sand \nand gravel to produce concrete threatens forest stock, \nincluding community-managed forests, which provide \nvaluable livelihoods.\n150 A key challenge for the built \nenvironment in Build  countries is to develop efficient \nand adaptive infrastructure and housing systems  \nwhile not undermining the ecosystems that provide \nessential resources. Circular economy principles can  \nbe applied throughout the built environment to  \ndeliver on these goals. Build countries should  \nfocus on circular solution numbers: Five, Seven  \nand Eight (see page 35).  \nEarthwork is a local, low-impact building \nmethod\nCompressed earth bricks—made from soil, \nnatural fibres and clay—can last for centuries, \nare easy to repair and boast a very low carbon \nfootprint.\n151 Worofila, Earthwork Construction  \nand Elementerre are companies in Africa that  \nare reviving earth-based construction methods, \nand reaping the benefits.\n152 One example of \nearthwork construction cut embodied energy  \nby 95% compared to a similar traditional  \nconcrete block construction. 153\nClimate adaptive building must bring together \nlocal materials, labour and knowledge\nThe Friendship Hospital in Bangladesh was \nbuilt to serve some of the most vulnerable \npopulations. Its construction employed local \ncraftsmen to make the most of local knowledge: \nthe building process addressed many climate \nconcerns, by utilising local building materials, \nusing surrounding water as a passive cooling \nmethod, and harvesting rainwater for reuse, \nfor example.\n154 The building’s environmental \nimpact was minimised, while ensuring trust and \nlegitimacy among the local population —and \nshaping a beneficial environment for the mental \nand physical health of the hospital’s patients.\n155 \nClimate justice and unequal access to healthcare \nwere central concerns, as was the use of \nsustainable, local building materials—serving to \ncut emissions and lower waste.\n156\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n45\n44\n",

ACHIEVE CIRCULAR \nMANUFACTURED GOODS AND \nCONSUMABLES\nBuild countries typically do not have extensive \nmanufacturing industries. 157 As a result, energy and \nfossil fuel use is low. Material extraction and use \nand waste generated is also low—just 13% of the \nglobal material footprint and only 11% of global solid \nwaste. However, they do incur disproportionate social \nimpacts at the two ends of the supply chain: global \nextraction and waste management activities. Mining \nactivities in Build countries have infamously led to \nthe displacement of populations, violent conflict and \nhuman rights violations.\n158 At the same time, once \nproducts from material streams such as textiles, \nplastics, and electronics reach their end-of-life, they \nare shipped from Shift  countries—often illegally.\n159 160 \n161 The majority of Build countries have highly informal \nwaste management sectors that process very toxic\nconsumer goods—often imported from abroad. 162 This \nleads to the disposal of harmful substances but also \nlost value since many products can be repaired.\n163 164 \nA circular economy can help these countries leapfrog \nto sustainable industrial activities, particularly when \ncapitalising on exponential technologies and system \nefficiencies. The formalisation and revamping of waste \nmanagement holds important potential for improving \nlabour conditions. At the same time, circular strategies \ncan help unlock service-led development, particularly \nfor highly-productive stages of the value chain such \nas technical services, including repair, remanufacture, \nand reuse activities for electronics, machinery and \nequipment, for example.

The \ncentre employs 40 people , and involves over 1,000 \nstaff in collection. In Nigeria, E-waste Producer \nResponsibility Organisation Nigeria (EPRON) \nfinances the collection and processing of e-waste \nby fees and levies charged to producers.\n165 \nEPRON aims to reduce and safely recover the \nover 52,000 tonnes of brominated plastics , 4,000 \ntonnes of lead, 80 tonnes of cadmium and over \n300 kilograms of mercury which are otherwise \nburned or dumped in Nigeria every year\n166 by an \nestimated 100,000 informal waste workers. 167\nThe Circular Fashion Partnership accelerates  \na circular textiles industry in Bangladesh\nThe Partnership connects large suppliers, \nrecyclers and brands operating in Bangladesh \nto build the necessary infrastructure to process \npost-production textile waste and unworn \nclothes.\n168 To date, around 1,500 tonnes of \ntextile waste has been captured through the \nPartnership—which has also hosted more \nthan one hundred summits, masterclasses and \nroundtables convening leaders to drive action \nand create opportunities for collaboration. If \ndeveloped sufficiently, this collaboration can  \nform the basis of a more permanent form of \nindustrial symbiosis, closing the loop on textile \nwaste and losses.\n169\n4. DRIVE FORWARD CIRCULAR \nTRANSPORT\nBuild countries have contributed very little to the \ncurrent overshoot, yet they often lack access to safe, \naffordable, efficient and sustainable transport and \nmobility.\n170 However, this picture is changing with one \nof the fastest vehicle growth rates globally. 171 Driven \nby rapid population and economic growth coupled \nwith urbanisation, Sub-Saharan Africa especially is \ngoing through a mobility revolution.

TRANSFORM THE  \nFOOD SYSTEM\nIn Grow countries, rising incomes are paralleled by \nshifts in dietary patterns: particularly an increase in \nhigh impact foods like meat and rising food waste: all \nkey drivers of overshoot and adverse health impacts. \nFor instance, between 1990 to 2019, daily meat \nconsumption per person doubled in Mexico and Brazil, \nand nearly tripled in China, while the share of plant-\nbased proteins went down in all of them.\n175 Today, \nChina alone consumes 28% of the meat produced \nglobally. Increasing affluence has also led to large-\nscale food waste. China, for instance, wastes 6% (or 35 \nmillion tonnes) of the country’s total food production \nper year.\n176 These two trends are a core challenge of \nGrow countries’ food systems: how to ensure adequate \nnutrition for a rapidly growing population that can be \ndecoupled from increasing environmental pressures \nfrom food production and waste. At the same time, \nmany Grow countries are agricultural powerhouses \nand major agro exporters of commodities such as \nsoybeans, poultry, pork and beef. Shifting towards \nmore sustainable and circular production (farming \npractices) and consumption (diets) are key, particularly \nby downscaling most impactful processes (livestock \nproduction and consumption).\n177 Grow countries \nshould focus on circular solution numbers: One, \nTwo, Three and Four (see page 33).\nAlternative low-impact proteins can address \nthe growing food waste challenge\nThai business Global Bugs produces cricket \nprotein: a low-cost, complete source of protein \nand ‘superfood’ that requires one-sixth less feed, \n1/1,000th the amount of water, and 1/20,000th \nthe amount of land compared to the same \namount of beef .

Insect protein farm systems \ncan, therefore, be designed in a circular way.\n178\nNew dietary guidelines to cut per capita meat \nconsumption by 2030 have emerged in China\nIn 2022, China introduced new guidelines that \naim to reduce per person meat consumption by \nhalf, listing cultivated meats and other plant-\nbased ‘future foods’ as suitable protein sources \nin its five-year plan. If effective, China’s efforts to \nshift the messaging around healthy diets—with a \nfocus on eating less meat and potentially avoiding \nred meat altogether, prioritising local products \nand reducing food waste—could inspire other \ncountries to adopt a similar approach.\n179 180 \n2.

Of net additions to stock in 2018, \napproximately two-thirds (65%) occurred in Grow \ncountries. This stock build up is unprecedented in \nhistory and has been the main driver of global material \ndemand growth in the last two decades.\n182 183 Brazil, \nRussia, China and South Africa represent a significant \nportion of the increase in demand for sand and gravel, \nfor example, while China alone accounts for roughly \nhalf of global cement production.\n184 185 A circular built \nenvironment needs to address two core challenges: \nhow to deliver high quality housing and infrastructure \nservices for the world’s fastest growing economies \nwhile leveraging the cutting edge of resource efficient \nsolutions.

UK-based \nSmall Robot Company provides solutions as a  \npart of a farming-as-a-service model: robots  \nthat seed and care for individual plants in \nfarmers’ crops, ensuring each one gets the  \nright amount of nutrients and water. 208 While still \nin an early phase, these technologies can support \nthe scale up of regenerative agriculture practices \nsuch as multi cropping and cover cropping. \nMachine learning can help farmers anticipate \nproblems, reduce waste and create adaptive \nstrategies to maximise yields and profits over  \nthe growing season .209\nSouth Korea has transformed its food waste \nrecovery process\nIn 1995, less than 2% of food waste was \nrecycled— a figure that increased to 95% by 2019 \nfollowing a 2005 ban on landfilling food waste .210 \nThis success is thanks to a comprehensive policy \nfeaturing a ‘pay-per-use’ scheme and bins for \nfood waste disposal, which cost an average family \naround €6 per month to use. 211 This organic waste \nis then used to supplement animal feedstock and \nproduce compost for urban farming initiatives. 212\n2. BUILD A CIRCULAR BUILT \nENVIRONMENT\nHistorically, Shift  countries have a high level of \nurbanisation as compared to the rest of the world, \nwith 50 to 80% of the population already living in \nurban areas by the 1950s. 213 Today, almost three-\nquarters of the population in the EU lives in urban \nareas and more than 80% in the US and UK. However, \npopulation growth, urbanisation and growing affluence \nare driving an expansion of the built environment \noutside of highly compact urban areas into suburbs \nand countryside. Some key factors here are the \nincrease of single households, as well as people buying \nbigger homes outside of highly dense urban areas, \nwhere costs are lower and floor space is greater. 214 \nThis phenomenon is characterised by high personal \nvehicle dependency and bigger floor space on average, \nand is a major driver of adverse environmental \nconsequences, such as landscape fragmentation, \nbiodiversity loss, water, air and noise pollution. 215 \nDecreasing household size perversely drives up new \nhousing demand. Smaller household size means lower \nefficiency, increased construction and increased land \nuse—all of which add up to much more resource use \nand environmental impact.  Shift countries should \nfocus on circular solution numbers: Five, Six, Seven \nand Eight (see page 35).\nLow-carbon materials, circular design and \nefficient manufacturing drives down impact\nInternational architecture collective Superuse \nStudios tackles each stage of the construction \nprocess, with a focus on harvesting and reusing \nconstruction materials in its circular designs, 216 \nwhile UK-based Premier Modular specialises in \nfast-tracked and sustainable development of \nmodular buildings. 217 Also based in the UK,  \nTopHat Homes creates houses with significantly \nless embodied carbon: their homes save  \n61,000 kilograms of CO 2 over the life of a  \nhouse, which is just 45% of the CO 2 produced  \nby a traditional home .218\nThe Dutch Environmental Performance of \nBuildings (MPG) method takes a lifecycle \napproach to prioritising sustainability\nThe Dutch government has the ambition to \nhalve virgin material consumption by 2030 219—\nnecessitating an approach that minimises \nbuildings’ impacts across their entire lifecycles. \nMost regulations in the EU and beyond focus on \nthe energy consumption of a building during its \nuse phase, but the MPG brings the environmental \nimpact of the materials used into scope.  As such, \nit addresses the issue that as buildings become \nmore energy-efficient, the climate impact of the \nmaterials they contain increases as a share of \nthe buildings’ total lifecycle impact. 220 In this way, \nthe MPG addresses certain tradeoffs: that more \nenergy-efficient buildings may come with a higher \ncarbon footprint in terms of their materials.\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n53\n52\n",

ACHIEVE CIRCULAR \nMANUFACTURED GOODS AND \nCONSUMABLES\nSince the development of a solid industrial economy \nin the late 19th and 20th centuries, Shift  countries \nhave become more service-oriented.\n221 The ensuing \nprocess of ‘deindustrialisation’ resulted in offshoring \nmany industrial and manufacturing activities—\nparticularly the most energy- and material-intensive—\nto Grow countries, where social and environmental \nregulations are often laxer and less enforced. Despite \nthis transition, the material footprint of consumption \nin Shift  countries is more than 13 times higher than \nlow-income countries.\n222 Essentially, Shift  countries \nhave increased their reliance on the extraction and \nprocessing of materials from elsewhere in the world to \nfuel their excessive consumption of products such as \ntextiles,\n223 plastics 224 and electronics. 225 And inefficient \npractices prevail: many electronics have lifetimes that \nare 2.3 years shorter than their designed or desired \nlifetimes. Currently, the average EU citizen consumes \n18 kilograms of electrical and electronic products \nper year—a high rate compounded by planned \nobsolescence and the lack of repairable designs. \nShift  countries should focus on drastically reducing \nmaterial consumption and maximising the lifetime of \nimpactful products. Regarding production processes: \ndomestically, the focus should be on investing in \ncleaner, low-carbon and material-efficient technologies \nthat reduce the environmental footprint of production \nactivities. Shift  countries should engage in technology- \nand knowledge-transfers, as well as providing access to \nfinance to allow for the reduction of the environmental \nimpacts of the international supply chains they rely \non. Shift countries should focus on circular solution \nnumbers: Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve (see page \n37).\nFrance launches a repairability rating for \nconsumer electronics\nReleased in 2021, the index will be further \nexpanded to include durability criteria in 2024. 226 \nThe rating has received positive public support, \nand is a crucial step in supporting France’s \nobjective to extend product lifetimes, mirroring \nthe US Right to Repair bill and the EU Sustainable \nProducts Initiative . Already, consumers are using \nthe index to aid their purchasing decisions: \naround two-thirds of the shoppers provided with \nthe ratings found it helpful for making choices , \nsuggesting that it could already be having a \npositive impact on consumer behaviour.\n227\nIKEA commits to transforming its entire \nvalue-chain\nIKEA has committed to becoming circular by 2030, \ntaking a holistic approach to transform its entire \nsupply chain while improving working conditions. \nIt aims to use only renewable or recycled \nmaterials in its products: currently, 55.8% of \nthe materials it sources are renewable, while \n17.3% are recycled.  IKEA aims to provide circular \nproduct offerings by giving customers access to \nsolutions and services that keep products in use, \nincluding a care and repair range, buyback and \nresell options, a circular hub, and the opportunity \nto purchase second-hand—with a furniture rental \nservice being explored.\n228 229\n4. DRIVE FORWARD CIRCULAR \nTRANSPORT\nShift  countries have many systemic inefficiencies \nwhen it comes to transport and mobility, such as low \nutilisation and excessive vehicle weight. Although \nexact statistics vary from country to country, generally, \nprivate car ownership and use are very high, as is oil \nuse per capita. In terms of air travel, the richest half of \nthe world (high and upper-middle income countries) is \nresponsible for 90% of aviation emissions.\n230 Circular \nstrategies should focus on avoiding or reducing \nthe need to travel by cutting private vehicle use, \nespecially those with combustion engines, designing \ncar-free cities, and promoting rail over short-haul \nflights. Similarly, switching to more active and energy-\nefficient modes is imperative. This can be incentivised \nby investing in clean, reliable and affordable public \ntransport while incentivising active transport, making \nlightweight shared electric vehicles one of the last \noptions. Shift countries should focus on circular \nsolution numbers: Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen and \nSixteen (see page 39).\nDutch cycling culture emerged in response to \nresource scarcity\nEnabled by safety concerns and an energy crisis \nin the 1970s, the Netherlands abolished major \nurban highway projects, and started prioritising \npolicies that promote safe, healthy and clean \nmobility along with vibrant street life.\n231 In  \nthe Netherlands today, 27% of all trips are  \nmade by bike—and with 17 million inhabitants, \nthe country boasts 23 million bikes . Cycling  \nbenefits both physical and mental health, \nincreases social interaction, allows for  \nresidents to cut transport costs and improves  \nair quality. 232 Recent estimates showed that if \neveryone world-wide cycled as much as the \nDutch, global emissions would drop by 686 \nmillion tonnes of CO\n2 per year.233\nLynk & Co offers a true opportunity for car \nsharing\nWith its flexible mobility memberships, Lynk & \nCo successfully turns mobility into a service. Its \nsubscriptions and car-sharing platform offers a \nmore sustainable alternative to traditional car \nownership. Empowering customers to share  \ntheir cars improves vehicle utilisation and makes \nbetter use of limited urban space. In 2021,  \nLynk & Co delivered 7,500 cars with almost  \n1,000 borrowers and lenders  using the car-\nsharing platform. Among other sustainability \nactions, Lynk & Co dominantly focuses on \nencouraging sustainable car use, creating  \nmobility inclusion, circulating materials and \ndeveloping sustainable and electric cars.\n234\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n55\n54\n",

      "content": "TAKE\nACTION\n5\nThis report has focused on the important role \nthat materials have on two deeply intertwined \nsystems: people and planet. Enacting a global \ncircular economy must be framed within the higher \ngoal of bringing human activity within ecological \nceilings and above social minimums. This analysis \ndemonstrates how circular material management—\ndoing more with less, using longer, and closing the \nloop—is an effective strategy to achieve this goal. \nA global transition to a circular economy means \nthat we could deliver people’s needs with just 70% \nof the current material demand, while bringing \nhuman activity back within the safe limits of the \nplanet. Yet bringing about this systemic change will \nnot only require a deep, large-scale transformation \nof consumption and production patterns, but an \neconomy that is oriented towards new principles \naltogether. This final chapter provides three key \ngoals to rally behind, and clear actions for policy \nmakers and business leaders.\nDelivering a good quality of life to a growing and \ndynamic population while respecting the limits of our \nplanet will require a fundamental transformation of \nhow we use material resources to fulfil needs. This \nreport has identified four global systems where this \ntransformation needs to happen, and has illustrated \n16 bold solutions to deliver that change. But what is \nalso needed is a shared vision that unites us towards \na common purpose. We propose three key priorities \nto guide the implementation of a circular economy \nthat will necessitate bold business strategies and \ninstitutional reform to fulfil the higher goal of  \nwellbeing within boundaries. Without reduction, \nregeneration and redistribution,  the circular economy  \nis just an empty promise.\n235\nREDUCE:  FROM EFFICIENCY TO \nSUFFICIENCY, RESILIENCE AND \nADAPTIVENESS\nThe economy is embedded in nature and \nnature has limits. We must, therefore, \nalso prioritise the efficient transformation \nof materials into societal benefits. This \nmeans that a circular economy must \npush for lifestyles that shift away from \noverconsumption—and towards ones that \ninvest in systems that support human \nthriving while systematically reducing \nwaste and pollution, and use materials more \nefficiently.\nACTIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\nPrioritise wellbeing as a primary indicator \nof economic progress and incorporate \nwellbeing indicators in the policy making \nprocess. Furthermore, countries can establish \nconsumption-based footprint reduction targets \nthat aim to bring production and consumption \nwithin sustainable limits. Countries including \nScotland, New Zealand, Iceland, Wales and \nFinland have begun to adopt wellbeing \nindicators in recent years.\n236 Meanwhile,  \nnational governments can set a baseline for \ntheir material footprint and level of circularity \nusing the Circularity Gap Report methodology, \nand follow Sweden’s example by introducing \nthe first consumption-based carbon footprint \nreduction target.\n237 238\nACTIONS FOR BUSINESS LEADERS\nExplore a wide range of sufficiency-based \nbusiness strategies that expand the value that \nyour business can extend to your customers. \nSuch strategies could include product lifetime \nextension services such as repair, customisation, \nor exchanges for products and services that \nbetter match customer needs. Simultaneously, \ntransform your operations to optimise the \nresource efficiency of your products and \nproduction processes, and expand your  \ncapacity to repair and remanufacture goods  \nthat are already in use.\n239 Follow the example \nof IKEA, which has set an ambitious circularity \ntarget and is working to transform its offerings \nand internal operations.\n240\nNEXT STEPS FOR \nBUSINESSES, \nCITIES AND \nCOUNTRIES\nThe Circularity Gap Report  2023\n57\n56",

Regenerative \nsystems support so many elements of \nhuman life, from nutrition and materials to \nthe production of clean air and water. We \nmust also respect and support its capacity \nto regenerate, by minimising pollution, \nprotecting ecosystems, building soil health \nand strengthening biodiversity, for example. \nMany regenerative solutions already exist \ntoday that give us tremendous hope that we \ncan move humanity from being net-negative \nto net-positive on Earth’s life support system.\nACTIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\nCreate financial incentives based on the \ninclusion of environmental impacts in the  \ncost of goods and services. One well known \nexample is the Ex’tax model, which proposes  \nto shift the tax burden from labour to  \n pollution, waste and natural resource \ndepletion.\n241 242 Governments can systematically \nmeasure and monitor natural capital and \nadjust tax incentives and subsidies to better \nsupport decarbonisation and natural resource \nmanagement, ensuring that the regenerative \ncapacity of its territories and natural assets are \nenhanced, not degraded.\n243 244\nACTIONS FOR BUSINESS LEADERS\nMove away from non-renewable materials  \nand practices that deplete ecosystems,  \nand restructure your business models to \nactively strengthen the regenerative capacity \nof both people and planet. Follow the example \nof Patagonia, which has sourced many of its \nmaterials from regenerative farms while directly \nsupporting, empowering and promoting the \nwork of smallholder farmers.\n245\nREDISTRIBUTE:  FROM ACCUMULATION \nTO DISTRIBUTION\nThere is currently enough wealth and \nmaterials in the world to provide a good \nquality of life to every single human being on \nthis planet.\n246  The challenge is ensuring that \nwe can distribute the access to materials to \nan increasingly expanding group of people, \nrequiring redistribution, different lifestyles, \nbetter technologies and social innovations.\n247 \nBy moving away from ownership and \naccumulation and towards models of access \nthat distribute resources more equally, we \ncan move towards a system that provides \nhigh-quality services to all.\nACTIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\nGovernments can invest in the commons: \nfrom public transport, parks and nature \nreserves, to public housing and renewable \nenergy infrastructure, to healthcare and \nsocial services.\n248 A strong backbone of \npublic infrastructure and services means that \neveryone can have equal access to high-quality \ngoods and services to meet their daily needs. \nGovernments can also steer the transition to                                 \na circular economy by enabling a just transition \nfrom inherently linear industries—like the \nfossil fuel industry—towards inherently circular \nindustries like repair and waste management.\n249 \n250 Practical examples of existing policy tools \nrange from energy taxes to carbon pricing. 251 \nThese should be scaled to accelerate ongoing \nstructural and distributional shifts, mirroring \nexamples such as the use of carbon dividends\n252 \nin Switzerland 253 and Canada. 254\nACTIONS FOR BUSINESS LEADERS\nMove towards service-based business  \nmodels that deliver all the essential services  \nthat customers want. Manage the flow of goods  \nand materials with circular production processes \nsuch as remanufacturing, repurposing and \nrepairing. Leverage digital technologies to \nenable Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) such as \nTagItSmart, which has developed smart tags  \nthat allow manufacturers, consumers and \nrecyclers to track every step of a product’s \nlifecycle, and provides information on how  \nto ensure circularity.\n255\n58\n The Circularity Gap Report  2023\n 59",

      "content": "<chunk>\nThe global economy is only 7.2% circular, and this is worsening yearly due to rising material extraction and use.  Over the six years of the Circularity Gap Report, the global economy extracted and used more materials than in the entire 20th century. This improved living standards but exceeded safe environmental limits. Global circularity has fallen from 9.1% in 2018 to 7.2% in 2023.  A circular economy focused solely on cycling materials cannot keep pace with the unprecedented rise in virgin material use; recycling alone is insufficient.  A circular economy could fulfill human needs with 70% of currently used materials, staying within planetary boundaries. Currently, five of nine key planetary boundaries are breached, largely due to the linear 'take-make-waste' economy.  Adopting a circular economy could reduce global material extraction by about one-third, primarily by reducing fossil fuel (especially coal) use and lowering demand for high-volume minerals like sand and gravel.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "Global circularity is dangerously low (7.2%), declining from 9.1% in 2018, due to escalating material consumption exceeding environmental limits.  Recycling alone is insufficient; a fully circular economy, reducing material use by ~70%, is needed to meet human needs within planetary boundaries.  Transitioning would reduce material extraction by roughly one-third, primarily by decreasing fossil fuel and high-volume mineral use.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\nThe executive summary highlights four key circular economy principles: use less, use longer, use again, and make clean.  These underpin the 16 circular solutions presented, emphasizing that a circular economy is more than just recycling.  The solutions focus on decreasing virgin material extraction, improving material use and lifespan, substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy and toxic materials with regenerative ones, and boosting secondary material use. The aim is to optimize material use for the well-being of all, minimizing consumption and focusing on circular materials management.  Focusing on 16 transformational circular solutions across four key systems (Food systems, Built environment, Manufactured goods and consumables, and Mobility and transport) could reverse the overshoot of five key planetary boundaries, maintaining thriving ecosystems and limiting global temperature rise to within 2 degrees.  The analysis is unconstrained by political, economic, and social dynamics, serving as an inspirational snapshot of a possible alternative world.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "This executive summary proposes 16 circular economy solutions across four key systems (food, built environment, goods, mobility) to achieve a more sustainable future.  The solutions prioritize reducing resource consumption (\"use less, use longer, use again, make clean\") by minimizing virgin material use, extending product lifespans, and utilizing renewable and regenerative materials. This approach aims to reverse planetary boundary overshoot and limit global warming, though the analysis ignores practical political, economic, and social limitations.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\nThe introduction notes that the year preceding the report's publication witnessed significant global challenges like pandemics, droughts, wildfires, and geopolitical instability, all exacerbated by climate breakdown.  The report highlights the urgency of addressing known issues like unsustainable lifestyles and an economic system prioritizing GDP over planetary well-being. It presents hard truths about how the linear economic model has pushed planetary boundaries to dangerous levels but also offers solutions demonstrating how societal needs can be met within planetary boundaries using circular principles. Some solutions are simple, while others require radical collaboration and lifestyle changes among the world's wealthiest. The overarching goal is to create an economy that emulates nature's circularity.  Materials have driven human affluence and rising living standards, but this progress came at a cost: a linear, fossil-fuel-powered, and unjust economic system. This linear economy has exceeded planetary boundaries, impacting not only GHG emissions but also biodiversity loss, water stress, and several other key ecological factors. While rising material use has improved living standards, research suggests that beyond a certain point, wellbeing plateaus. Unequal distribution of affluence has also exacerbated this issue.  However, a more sustainable future is emerging through coordinated climate action beyond GHG emission reduction,  with some countries incorporating circularity into their climate targets.  The report highlights the global need for a circular economy and explores various facets of this transition.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "The report highlights the urgent need for a circular economy to address global challenges exacerbated by climate change and unsustainable consumption.  It criticizes the linear economic model's exceeding of planetary boundaries,  emphasizing the disproportionate impact on the environment and the need for systemic change, including lifestyle shifts among the wealthy.  While acknowledging the benefits of material progress, it stresses that wellbeing plateaus beyond a certain point.  The report ultimately proposes solutions and showcases emerging initiatives towards a circular economy that emulates nature's processes.\n",

The Circularity Metric, representing the share of secondary materials in the economy, has fallen from 9.1% to 7.2%, reflecting both insufficient cycling and increasing virgin extraction. The report introduces a more holistic view by examining different material inputs (circular, renewable, non-renewable, and fossil fuels) and stock build-up.  Renewable inputs (biomass) have also grown significantly, but unsustainable practices raise concerns about land system change and carbon neutrality. Non-renewable inputs (metals and non-metallic minerals) show substantial growth, especially non-metallic minerals due to the construction industry.  Non-circular inputs (fossil fuels) remain impactful despite a relatively smaller share of total material input. Stock build-up, representing a large portion of total material input, has grown dramatically, largely in rapidly developing countries. The report illustrates material flows into various parts of the economy, highlighting areas where circular strategies can be most effective. Four key strategies for a circular economy are identified: narrow (use less), slow (use longer), regenerate (make clean), and cycle (use again).  The report also acknowledges challenges in quantifying circularity, such as the limitations of mass-based cycling metrics and the infeasibility of 100% circularity. The social justice aspect of a circular economy is also emphasized, highlighting the need for a systems redesign to ensure equitable access to resources.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "Global material extraction has tripled since 1970, driven by population growth and increased consumption, especially in high-income nations.  Circularity is declining (from 9.1% to 7.2%), despite growth in renewable inputs (biomass).  Unsustainable practices and stock build-up (especially in developing countries) are major concerns.  The report advocates for a circular economy using four strategies: reduce consumption, extend product lifespan, use clean materials, and recycle.  Challenges in quantifying circularity and ensuring social equity are acknowledged.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\nThe chapter on reversing the overshoot focuses on regaining balance between human needs and planetary health. It uses the Planetary Boundaries framework to analyze the impact of circular solutions.  The report models scenarios exploring the potential of a global circular economy to reverse the overshoot of planetary boundaries and achieve wellbeing within safe limits. The analysis focuses on four key systems: food systems, the built environment, manufactured goods and consumables, and mobility and transport.  The planetary boundaries framework identifies nine interconnected processes crucial to planetary health; five of these are currently transgressed.  The analysis considers how the four key systems contribute to the overshoot, emphasizing the interconnectedness of various activities.  Implementing a circular economy across these four systems could reduce virgin material extraction by roughly one-third (34%), reduce GHG emissions sufficiently to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees, and reverse the current overshoot of five planetary boundaries. A key assumption is a complete transition to clean energy, replacing fossil fuels with renewables for electricity generation and industrial purposes, further reducing the overall material footprint.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "This chapter examines how a global circular economy, focusing on food, buildings, goods, and transport, can reverse exceeding planetary boundaries.  Modeling shows that this approach, coupled with a complete transition to clean energy, could reduce material extraction by 34%, limit global warming to 2 degrees, and reverse the overshoot of five planetary boundaries, ultimately achieving wellbeing within safe limits.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\nThe chapter on different countries and circular solutions emphasizes the need for tailoring circular economy interventions to local contexts. The report uses three country profiles (Build, Grow, Shift) based on social performance and ecological footprint to prioritize suitable circular solutions. The myth that population growth directly leads to overshoot is debunked; the focus should be on aligning material use with essential needs while optimizing wellbeing indicators.  Shift countries, responsible for most of the overshoot, need to focus on reducing overconsumption. Grow countries should stabilize and optimize material consumption to maximize societal wellbeing. Build countries should focus on infrastructure development and wellbeing, even if it leads to increased material footprint.  The report provides specific circular economy solutions tailored to each country profile.  **Build countries** (low HDI, low ecological footprint) should focus on regenerative food systems, material-smart technologies for the built environment, and service-led development for manufacturing, and efficient mobility solutions like cargo bikes and locally-manufactured public transport.  **Grow countries** (medium HDI, high ecological footprint) require sustainable food production and consumption, resource-efficient solutions for the built environment, cleaner manufacturing technologies, and efficient public transport systems.  **Shift countries** (high HDI, high ecological footprint) must prioritize reducing overconsumption in food systems, promoting energy-efficient buildings, using less impactful materials in manufacturing, and transitioning to active and shared mobility systems.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "This report advocates for context-specific circular economy solutions.  It categorizes countries (Build, Grow, Shift) based on their social and ecological profiles, recommending different priorities: Build countries should focus on infrastructure and wellbeing; Grow countries on optimizing material consumption; and Shift countries on drastically reducing overconsumption.  Specific circular economy solutions are proposed for each category, addressing areas like food systems, construction, manufacturing, and transportation.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\nThe final chapter stresses the importance of a shared vision for a global circular economy, emphasizing three key priorities: reduce, regenerate, and redistribute.  **Reduce** focuses on shifting from efficiency to sufficiency, resilience, and adaptiveness, prioritizing wellbeing and reducing material use.  Policymakers should prioritize wellbeing indicators and set consumption-based footprint reduction targets. Businesses should explore sufficiency-based strategies, extend product lifespans, and optimize resource efficiency.  **Regenerate** emphasizes shifting from extraction to regeneration, respecting the Earth's capacity to regenerate.  Policymakers should create financial incentives for environmentally friendly practices and natural capital management. Businesses should move away from depleting practices and actively enhance regeneration.  **Redistribute** calls for a shift from accumulation to distribution, ensuring equitable access to resources.  Policymakers should invest in public goods and infrastructure and enable a just transition to circular industries. Businesses should move towards service-based models and utilize digital technologies to enhance circularity. The chapter concludes by reiterating the need for transformative change in consumption and production, emphasizing the importance of these three key principles for achieving a sustainable future.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "The final chapter advocates for a global circular economy based on three priorities:  reducing material consumption by prioritizing wellbeing and sufficiency; regenerating natural resources through incentivized environmentally friendly practices; and redistributing resources equitably through public investment and service-based business models.  Transformative change in consumption and production is crucial for achieving sustainability.\n",
