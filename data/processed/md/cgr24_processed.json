WALTER VERRI\nUndersecretary of Industry, \nEnergy and Mining Uruguay\n‘Despite the growing global evocation of the circular \neconomy, the Circularity Gap Report 2024 reveals \na discordance between the discourse and the \nmeasurements of circularity that are being recorded \nglobally. For countries like Uruguay, with an economy \nso strongly linked to the use of its natural resources, \nwe recognise the circular economy as an imperative \nfor economic development and call on our fellow \nnations for the international collaboration that is \nneeded to make this a reality.’\n7\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n6\n\n\nDespite the circular economy entering the \nmainstream, global circularity is still in \ndecline. \nOver the past five years, the volume of discussions, \ndebates, and articles addressing this topic has almost \ntripled, reflecting a heightened awareness and interest \nin circularity. 1 However, the vast majority of extracted \nmaterials entering the economy are virgin, with the \nshare of secondary materials declining steadily since \nthe Circularity Gap Report began measuring it: from \n9.1% in 2018 to 7.2% just five years later in 2023. \nMeanwhile, the total amount of materials consumed by \nthe global economy continues to rise: in just the past \nsix years alone we have consumed over half a trillion \ntonnes of materials—nearly as much as the entirety \nof the 20th century. These statistics display the cold, \nhard truth: despite the circular economy reaching \n‘megatrend’ status, lofty speeches and targets are \nnot yet translating into on-the-ground actions and \nmeasurable impacts. Without bold, urgent action to \nshift to a circular economy, we'll miss out on achieving \nbroader social and environmental goals—ranging from \nemissions reductions to boosting the use of secondary \nmaterials—putting industries and governments at risk \nof sleepwalking into circular washing and missing out \non much-needed impact. \nThe Circularity Gap Reports  have provided \ncrucial analysis and theory on the global \nstate of circularity since 2019. Now, it's time \nto put this theory into action. \nToday, six of the nine key ‘planetary boundaries’ that \nmeasure environmental health across land, water and \nair have been broken—largely due to the impacts of the \nlinear ‘take-make-waste’ economy. Our Circularity Gap \nReport 2023  found that adopting 16 circular economy \nsolutions could not only reverse the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries but also slash the global need \nfor material extraction by one-third. This reduction \nis rooted in the circular economy principles of using \nless for longer, using regenerative materials and \ncycling materials at their end-of-life. At this moment \nin time, we've never needed a circular economy more. \nWhile material consumption has been instrumental in \nraising living standards over the past century, we've \nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\nreached a unique point in history where its continued \nacceleration—in high-income countries—no longer \nguarantees  increases in human wellbeing. Meanwhile, \nthe unequal distribution of wealth and materials \nhugely destabilise society and strains Earth's life \nsupport systems. The world's wealthier nations can \nno longer use progress as an excuse for unrestricted \nmaterial consumption. The global economy needs to \nadopt circular principles to boost development and \nresilience and to safeguard people's wellbeing in this \ntime of uncertainty and transition. \nTo walk the talk, governments and industry \nmust break free of flawed development \npatterns that continue to fuel industries \nand practices known to be socially and \nenvironmentally exploitative.\nThey can do this by unlocking capital, rolling out \nbold, contextually-appropriate policies and closing \nthe sustainable and circular skills gap. In this year’s \nReport, we shift from exploring the what  to the how : \nexploring the different ways that we need to ‘change \nthe rules of the game’ and create a set of conditions \nthat discourage the overshoot of planetary boundaries \nand ‘undershoot’ of human development. This process \nhas resulted in us spotlighting 12 of the original 16 \nsolutions, highlighting the country profile that they are \nmost relevant to, as well as placing people at the centre \nof this story for the first time. Based on extensive \ninterviews and desk research, this Report aims to show \ngovernments and industry leaders that if they want \nto turn theory into action and scale an economy that \ndelivers on needs within the safe limits of the planet, \nthey need to dismantle harmful entrenched processes \nand align enabling elements:\n• Create a level policy playing field: Set the ‘rules \nof the game’ through policies and legal frameworks \nthat incentivise sustainable and circular practices \nwhile penalising harmful ones, thereby shaping \nthe nature and scale of economic activities across \nindustries and nations. \n• Get the economics right: Adjust fiscal policies and \nleverage public investment to create true prices and \nensure that circular solutions become more valuable \ninstruments and begin to replace linear norms.\n• Build circular expertise and skills: Ensure people \nare skilled and trained to ensure a just transition \nwhere opportunities and decent livelihoods are \nfairly distributed across and within societies.\nFor a just transition, we must take a systems-\nthinking approach in real-life applications of \nthe circular economy—both because systems \nchange must meet people’s needs and \nbecause people and their skills are necessary \nto implement the solutions themselves. \nAlthough human wellbeing is a broad concept that \nencompasses a range of social, emotional and physical \nfactors, this Report specifically focuses on how the \ncircular transition can support wellbeing through the \nprovision of decent work. Jobs act as a robust proxy \nfor human wellbeing as it speaks to many dimensions \nof the human experience: jobs fulfil concrete needs \nlike financial security while also providing a sense of \nmeaning and fulfilment, community and social mobility. \nDecent and meaningful livelihoods are the bedrock of \nthriving societies. This is why circular solutions must \nbe designed with the world’s most vulnerable in mind. \nDone right, the circular economy can do more than \ncreate jobs and deliver on people’s basic needs—it can \nelevate job quality and safety and reduce inequalities \nacross entire workforces and, with this, populations.\nA future-proof system must galvanise \nwellbeing by funnelling materials into \nindustries and practices that lift people \nup and repair the damage done to the \necosystems upon which we depend, while \ndegrowing harmful ones—especially in \nhigher-income countries. \nKey global systems put the most pressure on key \nEarth systems, driving us past the safe limits of six \nplanetary boundaries. However, these systems are vital \nfor fulfilling people’s needs. In this report, we focus \non transformative circular solutions across three key \nsystems:\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM nourishes populations and employs \n50% of the global workforce, but:\n• it currently drives a quarter of the overshoot on \nthe climate change planetary boundary due to its \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) production, \n• animal farming alone uses over one-quarter of all \nland, equivalent to the size of the Americas, 2\n• nearly a quarter of freshwater resources are lost due \nto rampant food waste, and\n• it is the single largest driver of biodiversity loss. 3\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,  including housing, \ncommercial buildings and the necessary \ninfrastructure for mobility, is essential for our \nlivelihoods, but:\n• the extraction of minerals used to produce \nconstruction materials is responsible for a quarter \nof global land use change,\n• approximately 40% of global GHG emissions can \nbe attributed to buildings’ construction, use and \ndemolition, and\n• construction and demolition processes drive nearly \none-third of all material consumption.\nMANUFACTURED GOODS,  such as vehicles, textiles, \nappliances and equipment and their associated \nproduction processes are big employers but:\n• production processes often rely on fossil fuels and \ncurrently drive one-third of the overshoot on the \nclimate change planetary boundary due to its GHG \nproduction,\n• material- and energy-intensive industrial activities \nare linked to deforestation and drive 15% on both \nthe land use and freshwater planetary boundaries, \n• manufacturing goods results in substantial \namounts of hazardous industrial waste and leaks \nchemicals into the environment.\nTo achieve global wellbeing within \nplanetary boundaries, we must prioritise \ncircularity-based development in lower-\nincome Build countries, promote circular \nindustrial processes in Grow  countries \nand shift consumption patterns in higher-\nincome Shift nations.\nUltimately, different countries will have different \npriorities in scaling a global circular economy and \nensuring that materials funnel into systems and \npractices that boost wellbeing within the safe limits of \nthe planet.\n9\n8\n8\n\n\nHigher-income Shift countries should \nradically reduce their material \nconsumption while upholding wellbeing.\nOn average, residents of Shift  countries—including \nthe US, Japan, the UK and Canada—enjoy affluent, \ncomfortable lifestyles, and perform well on social \nindicators, but they consume far more than their \nshare of materials. Despite housing around 17% of \nthe global population, they consume one-fourth \n(25%) of raw materials, and consume the most non-\nmetallic minerals and fossil fuels per capita of all \ncountry profiles. On average, Shift  countries’ per capita \nmaterial footprint of 22.6 tonnes is 4.6 times that of \nBuild countries (largely due to the overconsumption of \nconsumer goods imported from Grow  countries) and \n1.6 times that of Grow  countries. They also generate \n43% of global emissions. This country profile’s mission \nwill be to reduce its material consumption and \nultimately, lessen its impact on planetary boundaries, \nwhich currently comes at the expense of the global \nmajority.\nMiddle-income Grow countries should \nstabilise their material consumption.\nGrow countries—including, for example, China, \nIndonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam, Myanmar and \nEgypt—need to continue improving their people's \nquality of life, but in a way that is much more sensitive \nto planetary boundaries. Globally, they account for \n51% of the material footprint, while housing around \n37% of the global population. Their average per capita \nmaterial footprint is 17 tonnes per year. While these \ncountries contribute 41% of global emissions—almost \nas much as Shift  countries—their share of the global \npopulation is double that of Shift  countries.\nIncreased growth and incomes have led to a nutrition \ntransformation: diets are increasingly shifting in \nfavour of more animal-based proteins—such as \nmeat and dairy—and processed foods. While many \ncountries are and will likely remain key manufacturing \nand industrial hubs for the rest of the world’s—\nand their own—consumption, this necessitates a \nshift to make this sustainable environmentally and \nsupportive and safe for workers.\nLower-income Build countries should \nincrease their material consumption to \nfulfil their populations’ needs.\nBuild countries, such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, \nPakistan, the Philippines, and some small island states, \nfor example, account for 18.5% of the global material \nfootprint, despite being home to almost half (46%) \nof the population. Their material footprint per capita \nis just 5 tonnes per year—less than the estimated \nsustainable level of 8 tonnes per person per year. \nSimilarly, they contribute a relatively small share of \nglobal emissions: just 17%.\nAs these countries generally struggle to meet basic \nneeds for healthcare and education, their primary \nobjective is to improve living standards. This \nnecessitates increased material use to provide the \ninfrastructure, goods and services needed to improve \nwellbeing. It will also require uplifting workers in \nnations with prevalent informal economies, which are \nespecially common in the agricultural, forestry and \nwaste management sectors.\nAlthough much of their \ninfrastructure is already \nbuilt up, Shift  countries still \ncontribute heavily to planetary \nboundary overshoot: \n42% of the overshoot of the \nclimate change boundary\n27% of nitrogen\n18% of phosphorus\n16% of freshwater use\n38% of land use change\nBuild countries make a minimal \ncontribution to the overshoot \nof planetary boundaries, \ncontributing:\n8% of the overshoot of the \nclimate change boundary\n11% of nitrogen\n23% of phosphorus\n30% of freshwater use\n20% of land use change \nboundary\nGrow countries make a large \ncontribution to the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries—largely \nby producing materials to feed \nthe demand of higher-income \n(Shift) countries: \n50% of the overshoot of the \nclimate change boundary\n62% of nitrogen\n60% of phosphorus\n53% of freshwater use\n42% of land use change \n11\n10\n\n\nThe transition calls for radical collaboration \nand concerted efforts to avoid burden-\nshifting among industries, regions and \nresources—striving for a structural \ntransformation of production and \nconsumption. No one actor can spur \nchange alone: \n1. Ministries of Economy, Finance and the \nEnvironment, Business leaders, Multilateral \norganisations and International Financial Institutions \n(for example, the IMF and Development Banks) can \nSHIFT THE GOALPOSTS  by placing materials at the \ncentre of the story of achieving wellbeing within \nboundaries.\n2. Ministries of Economics, Finance and Trade, \nMultilateral organisations and International Financial \nInstitutions can WORK TOGETHER  to reform \ninternational financial and trade architecture to ensure \nall nations have the means to invest in sustainable \ndevelopment.\n3. Ministries of Economics, Finance, Educational \nInstitutions, Multilateral organisations and \nInternational Financial Institutions must GET THE \nECONOMICS RIGHT SO FINANCING CAN FOLLOW  \nby rolling out fiscal measures and new redistribution \nmechanisms and redesigning the system.\nHow?\nDevelop and apply holistic indicators.  \nWe must move beyond GDP and \nother traditional economic metrics to \nincorporate indicators that measure the \nthings that matter to people\nSet mission-oriented targets.  New \ntargets are needed to shift the goal \nfrom maximising economic output to \nmaximising human wellbeing within \nplanetary boundaries.\nHow?\nReform financial and trade patterns \nto promote circular solutions.  This \ncan unlock the potential of the circular \neconomy to improve social outcomes and \nthe environment. \nIncrease fair access to affordable \ncircular technological innovations.  \nTechnological transfer can improve access \nto existing technologies, and rethinking \ntrade policy can foster innovation in Build \nCountries.\nRoll out measures for debt cancellation \nand relief.  Debt cancellation and relief \nfor Build and Grow countries is essential \nbecause it enables them to invest in the \ncircular economy transition.\nHow? \nRedesign taxation to ensure that prices \nreflect and include all costs. This should \ninclude those linked to environmental and \nhealth impacts, and can be done through \ncarbon pricing and resource taxes.\nDismantle incentives for excessive \nmaterial consumption. We can not only \ncurb excessive consumption but also \nchannel the generated revenue into public \ngoods.\nComplement pricing signals with \nfee-and-dividend schemes. Other \nmechanisms can also complement and \nreinforce better pricing, with the ultimate \naim of limiting inflation and fostering \nsocial support.\n4. Ministries of Economics, Labour, Educational \nInstitutions, Multilateral organisations, Labour \nagencies and unions and Business leaders can FORGE \nGLOBAL COLLABORATION FOR A JUST TRANSITION  \nby aligning environmental goals with social and \neconomic ones across the world.\nHow?\nEnsure the circular economy transition \nis people-centric. Working towards a just \ntransition means leaving no one behind.\nBuild substantial support and \nleadership among governments \naround the world for this social \ntransition to take place. Transitioning \ntowards a circular economy requires \nstate planning, strong social policy \nand the implementation of specialised \npublic labour agencies that manage the \ntransition of workers.\nHarness policymakers’ creativity \nto achieve results within a tight \ntimeframe.  In Shift  countries, job \nguarantees and Just Transition Funds can \nbe used to support workers in resource-\nintensive industries that will undergo \nchanges, both in their own countries and \nin partner Grow  and Build  countries.\nEnsure education addresses the \ninevitable shift in jobs and skills. It \nis vital that the right basic education, \nVocational Education and Training (VET) \nand lifelong learning opportunities are \nmade available now.\nEnsure that circular, green employment \nmeans better employment. This \nincludes better representation, decent \npay and improved working conditions. \nNo matter what corner of the world or \nthe value chain we find ourselves in, it is \ncrucial that people everywhere have the \nopportunity to lead dignified lives.\nLet us set the stage for a global economy that \noperates by new rules—ones that promote \na level playing field and propel us toward a \nmore sustainable and equitable future.\n13\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n12\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n1\nINTRODUCTION\n16 – 21\n2\nWHERE TO FOCUS AND WHY\nBringing powerful solutions to life\n22 – 33\n3\nHOW TO ENABLE CIRCULARITY\nBuilding resilience in a destabilised world\n34 – 37\n4\nCIRCULARITY IN SHIFT  COUNTRIES\nRadically reduce material consumption and uphold wellbeing\n38 – 47\n5\nCIRCULARITY IN GROW  COUNTRIES\nStabilise material consumption and safeguard wellbeing\n48 – 57\n6\nCIRCULARITY IN BUILD  COUNTRIES\nIncrease material consumption to secure wellbeing\n58 – 67\n7\nWHO NEEDS TO DO WHAT\nHow to drive action\n68 – 73\nGLOSSARY\nCONTENTS\n14\n15\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n\nINTRO-\nDUCTION\n1\nHow can we ensure people’s wellbeing while \noperating within our planet’s key boundaries across \nair, land and water? This is the ultimate question \nof our time. At present, the global economy under-\ndelivers on many counts: the past years saw the \nemergence of the word ‘polycrisis’: the complex \nentanglement of global geopolitical, economic, \nenvironmental and social dilemmas. 4 And as these \nmultiple crises emerge, interact and worsen, \nwe’re failing to reverse their impacts and secure \na strong social foundation for much of the world’s \npopulation. Rising material consumption and \nexcessive waste drive profound—and increasing—\ndisparities in the distribution of wealth, materials \nand opportunities around the globe. But there is \nanother way: our Circularity Gap Report 2023 5 found \nthat through circular economy solutions, we can \nmeet people’s needs with one-third fewer materials \nthan we use today, reversing the overshoot of five \nplanetary boundaries. This Report takes the next \nstep to uncover the ‘how’ : building on last year’s 16 \nsolutions across four key systems—food, the built \nenvironment, manufactured goods and mobility—it \nspeaks to governments and industry leaders about \nhow they can turn theory into action. It considers \nhow enabling elements—policy, finance shifts and \nthe role of the workforce—can be leveraged to \nsupport the circular transition in all corners of the \nglobe, raising living standards in some places while \nlowering environmental impact. People are central \nto this story: we envision a transition in which no \none is left behind, that is safe and just for workers, \ncitizens and consumers. This Report is a guide: a \npractical action plan for solutions that support \nwellbeing within the planet’s healthy boundaries.\nTHE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST \nCENTURY\nMaterial consumption has been instrumental in \nraising living standards over the past century: \nglobally, a flood of goods, services and energy has \nenhanced life expectancy, increased employment \nand improved education. The visual below, \nhowever, also shows that as living standards—\nmeasured by the Human Development Index \n(HDI)—rise, so does ecological impact. 6,7 We know \nnow that material consumption is a solid proxy for \nenvironmental damage 8 with material handling \nand use contributing 70% of global greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions 9 and extraction and use \ndriving more than 90% of biodiversity loss and \nwater stress, for example. 10\n16\n17\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0.3\nShift  \ncountries\nWHILE MATERIALS  ARE VITAL FOR  \nHUMAN DEVELOPMENT —TO BUILD \nUP CRUCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE \nAND FULFIL HUMAN NEEDS  FOR \nNUTRITION, SHELTER AND MOBILITY, \nFOR EXAMPLE— THIS DEVELOPMENT \nPATTERN IS FUNDAMENTALLY \nFLAWED FOR FOUR KEY REASONS.\nGrow  \ncountries\nBuild  \ncountries\n1. THE EARTH CAN'T SUSTAIN INFINITE GROWTH IN MATERIAL \nCONSUMPTION\nThe modern economy is underpinned by linear practices that have driven \nexponential growth in material consumption, pollution and waste generation. \nBetween 2016 and 2021, the global economy has consumed 582 billion tonnes of \nmaterials—nearly as many materials as the 740 billion consumed in the entire \n20th century. This puts unsustainable pressure on Earth’s ecosystems and \nbiocapacity, far more than we need to equitably fulfil many societal needs. \n3. THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND MATERIALS \nPUTS IMMENSE STRAIN ON EARTH’S SYSTEMS AND DESTABILISES \nSOCIETIES\nBy exacerbating inequality, spurring political unrest and heightening social \ntension, the global economy’s production and consumption patterns are \nresulting in social unrest, war and mass migration. Climate breakdown is only \nserving to worsen this by further straining access to resources, and shrinking \nthe area of liveable land on Earth.\n2. RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION AND DRIVERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL \nIMPACTS ARE INCREASINGLY UNEQUAL\nA shrinking minority of people are driving the majority of environmental \nimpacts, both between and within nations. High-income nations are key drivers \nof ecological breakdown: EU nations and US alone are responsible for more than \nhalf of the globe’s material consumption, 11 despite housing just around one-\ntenth of the world’s population. The world's wealthiest 1% are responsible for \nthe carbon emissions of the poorest two-thirds, and have accumulated nearly \ndouble the money of the bottom 99%. 12\n4. THE CONTINUED ACCELERATION OF MATERIAL CONSUMPTION \nNO LONGER DELIVERS WELLBEING AND DESIRABLE PROGRESS\nMany high-income nations are at a saturation point: a unique time in history \nwhere increasing material consumption no longer delivers guaranteed \nincreases in human wellbeing. 13 More unequal societies are also unhappier \nones. The world’s wealthier nations can no longer use progress as an excuse for \nunrestricted material consumption. 14\nFigure one shows countries plotted along their Human Development Index and Material Footprint.  \nAs HDI rises, so do environmental impacts. We need a new economic model for the 21st century: one  \nthat maximises benefits for people and minimises the pressure on the planet’s life support systems.\nHuman Development Index (HDI)\nMaterial Footprint per capita\n(displayed as the number of planets needed to sustain \nthe lifestyle of each country’s average citizen)\n1918\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n\nBENDING THE CURVE: PROMOTING \nPEOPLE’S WELLBEING WITH SMART \nMATERIAL USE\nRethinking material consumption is crucial for \n‘bending the development curve’ towards a more \nenvironmentally safe and socially just future. Many \ncountries need to expand their economies to build \nmore solid social foundations—often resulting in the \nneed to grow or stabilise material consumption. In \norder to free up ecological space for these countries, \nthose with already strong economies and social \ninfrastructure should reduce their material footprints. \nRedistributing material resources is a critical step to \nensuring universal access to basic needs while staying \nwithin Earth’s safe limits. 15 If countries prioritise \nwellbeing, and better align material consumption \nwith a good quality of life—and make decisions \naccordingly—it is possible to bend development \npathways towards the ‘ecologically safe and socially \njust’ space for humanity. 16\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2023’s research, 17 in which \nwe explored the data of 148 countries between the years \nof 2005 and 2015, aptly illustrates this point. Our analysis \nidentified outlying countries that have taken three \ndistinct development pathways (refer to Chapter two for \nmore information). For one, some countries expanded \ntheir ability to deliver social needs without sharp \nincreases in material demand: countries such as Angola, \nEswatini, Togo, Nepal, the Gambia and South Africa, for \nexample, made strong progress on several wellbeing \nindicators—such as life expectancy, nutrition and access \nto energy—yet had stable, and even declining, material \nfootprints.18 Meanwhile, others injected significant \nvolumes of materials into their economies without any \ndiscernible change in quality of life.\nThe specific factors contributing to each country’s \nindividual development pathway are complex and \nunique, yet these few examples demonstrate the \nimportant point that raw material consumption, and \nthus environmental pressures, can be decoupled from \na high quality of life and standards of wellbeing. 19 This \nis where the circular economy comes in: its principles \nof using less, using longer, making clean and  using again  \ncan be implemented at the product, service, process \nand system levels to deliver a high quality of life to a \ngrowing and increasingly urbanised global population \nwithin the safe limits of the planet. \nThe Circularity Gap Report 2023 findings show that this \nis possible: we can deliver on societal needs such as \nhousing, nutrition, mobility and manufactured goods \nwith 30% less of the materials we use now, reversing \nthe overshoot of five planetary boundaries. \nSLOW\nUSE LONGER\nNARROW\nUSE LESS\nREGENERATE\nMAKE CLEAN\nCYCLE\nUSE AGAIN\nEND/hyphen.caseOF/hyphen.caseLIFE\nFUNCTIONAL\nUSE\nDESIGN\nFigure two depicts the four flows of the circular economy: a comprehensive framework for managing \nresource flows in a circular economy by using less (Narrow), using for longer (Slow), using again (Cycle), \nand using clean, regenerative materials and energy (Regenerate). 20 \nTHE GLOBAL TRANSITION MUST BE JUST \nAND PUT PEOPLE’S WELLBEING AT ITS \nCENTRE \nThe circular economy offers a means to provide for \npeople’s needs with much less environmental impact, \nbut is not socially just by default—it must be designed \nthat way. People-centric solutions are vital, both \nbecause systems change must meet people’s needs \nand because people and their skills are necessary to \nimplement the solutions themselves. Citizens, workers \nand consumers must all be considered in the design \nof circular solutions, to ensure no person, community \nor nation is left behind. The shift towards a ‘circular \nsociety’ 21—in which wellbeing is centre-stage—will not \nbe simple, however. Ambitious circular strategies, while \nwell-intentioned, may be prone to certain negative \neffects—implementing plastics bans without integrating \nmeasures to protect informal recycling workers can \ngenerate unforeseen negative impacts on livelihoods \nand workers’ ability to provide for their families, for \nexample. 22 Social justice must be embedded in policy- \nand decision-making processes to minimise these \nimpacts for those most vulnerable, or to find alternate \nsolutions that benefit people just as much as the planet.\nAlthough human wellbeing is a broad concept that \nencompasses a range of social, emotional and physical \nfactors, this Report specifically focuses on how \nthe circular transition can support wellbeing \nthrough the provision of decent work .23 Jobs act \nas a powerful proxy for human wellbeing as it speaks \nto many dimensions of the human experience: jobs \nfulfil concrete needs like financial security, while \nalso providing a sense of meaning and fulfilment, \ncommunity and social mobility. Decent and meaningful \nlivelihoods are the bedrock of thriving societies. This \nis why circular solutions must be designed with the \nworld’s most vulnerable in mind. Done right, the \ncircular economy can do more than simply create jobs \nand deliver on people’s basic needs—it can elevate job \nquality and safety, and reduce inequalities across entire \nworkforces and with this, populations.\nWorkers are also consumers . The average citizen should \nhave easy access to affordable solutions—be they in the \nform of goods or services—that provide greater value \nthan their linear counterparts. To this end, this report \nalso explores some consumer-centred solutions that \nsupport citizens in making more sustainable choices, \nholding politicians accountable and championing \nbottom-up initiatives. This is not to shift responsibility \nfrom businesses and governments to the every-day \nconsumer, but rather to highlight the importance of \naligning incentives with people’s needs: engineering a \ncircular economy with and for people. \nDrawing on the findings of the Circularity Gap Report \n2023, this report identifies impactful circular solutions \ntailored to different country profiles based on their \nenvironmental impact, their potential for positive \nsocio-ecological impact, and—ultimately—the unique \nmakeup of their economies, which feeds into what \ntheir people need and want.\n1.

While each of these \n16 solutions is applicable to all nations, certain \nsolutions may have higher impact and relevance in \ncertain geographies. \nWe can identify which circular solutions are the most \napplicable to each country profile by looking at the \nlocations of global production and consumption, trade \npatterns, labour market characteristics, the way in \nwhich countries consume materials and the way in \nwhich future socio-economic trends will shape material \nconsumption. \nIn doing so, we can single out leverage points in the \nglobal economy where specific activities, practices and \nmaterials create a disproportionate level of impact. \nThis process has resulted in us spotlighting 12 of the \noriginal 16 solutions, highlighting the country profile \nthat they are most relevant to.\nMAINSTREAM REGENERATIVE \nAGRICULTURE\nScale up agricultural practices that \nregenerate ecosystems, recirculate nutrients \nand sequester carbon by design.\nPUT HEALTHIER, SATIATING FOODS \nFIRST\nPrioritise satiating and healthy foods with a \nlower environmental impact—ideally shifting \ncalories from meat, fish and dairy towards \ncereals, fruits, vegetables and nuts.\nFOOD SYSTEM\nGlobally, the food system employs half of the global \nworkforce and is a key driver of the overshoot of \nmany planetary boundaries, responsible for: a \nquarter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 44% \nof global land use, 61% of freshwater withdrawal \nand 90% of phosphorus emissions to soil. Animal \nagriculture, intensive land management practices \nand food waste contribute the vast majority of \nthese impacts. Animal farming alone uses more \nthan a quarter of all land, releases almost 15% of \nGHG emissions and is responsible for two-thirds \nof all phosphorus emissions and one–third of all \nnitrogen emissions—enough to tip us past the \nboundary for nutrient overload. And while we \ntechnically produce enough food to feed everyone, \naround 800 million people still live in hunger. 24 The \nproduction of food that is either lost or wasted \naccounts for nearly a quarter of global cropland, \nup to 10% of GHG emissions, and nearly a quarter \nof the total freshwater resources used for food \nproduction. \nA circular food system must address the whole \nvalue chain, from production to consumption to \nwaste management. The four key solutions for the \nfood system are:\nGO LOCAL, SEASONAL AND \nORGANIC\nPrioritise the production and consumption \nof local, seasonal and organic produce \n(sometimes in combination with GMO to \nreduce pests and disease loss on crops), \nwhich can lead to a significantly reduced \nneed for chemical inputs, fuels, and \nprocessing services that contribute most to \nenvironmental impacts.\nEND AVOIDABLE FOOD WASTE\nMinimise food loss and valorise waste \nfollowing the food waste hierarchy along \nthe supply chain and at the consumer level \nthrough better management of transport \nand storage, more refrigeration and smart \nplanning, and technology at the consumer \nand food service levels.\n*The mobility system has not been included in this selection: \nthis is because the kinds of circular solutions that address \nmobility assets—vehicles like cars and bicycles to trains \nand aeroplanes—fall under the manufacturing system, \nwhile solutions that address mobility infrastructure—such \nas roads, bridges and railways—are considered in the built \nenvironment.\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n26\n\n\nMAKE THE MOST OF WHAT ALREADY \nEXISTS\nMake the most of existing materials by \nreusing, repurposing, upgrading and \nrenovating following circular approaches. \nWhere new builds are needed, use secondary \nmaterials and be as efficient as possible with \nurban planning solutions that follow circular \ndesign principles so that buildings can be \nreused, repurposed and easily disassembled \nin the future.\nUTILISE SECONDARY MATERIALS\nMaximise the high-value reuse of buildings \nand components where possible. Ideally, \nenable the utilisation of construction and \ndemolition outputs and ensure that as much \nof it as possible is recycled to avoid the need \nfor virgin materials, such as sand and gravel.\nPRIORITISE CIRCULAR MATERIALS \nAND APPROACHES\nTransition to using renewable wood, timber or \ncross-laminated timber instead of steel and \nconcrete, or move to other locally available \nmaterials. Utilise mainstream modular \nconstruction and prioritise lightweight frames \nand structures to reduce cement and steel \nuse, as well as green roofs where possible.\nBUILT ENVIRONMENT\nEncompassing houses, buildings and the roads \nwe use to get from A to B, the built environment \nis a massive sector with high impact. While cities \noccupy just 3% of the globe’s total land surface, the \nextraction of minerals used to produce construction \nmaterials is responsible for a quarter of global \nland use change. And what’s more— construction, \nbuilding use and demolition are responsible for \nover one-fifth of global nitrogen emissions and \nmore than half of atmospheric aerosol loading. \nMaking the built environment more circular must \nprioritise a heavy reduction in material use—while \nalso closing the loop on materials and bringing \nsecondary and renewable material choices to \nthe fore. Our four key solutions for the built \nenvironment are:\nBE AS ENERGY EFFICIENT AS \nPOSSIBLE\nFrom the design phase, utilise circular \nstrategies to create material- and energy \nefficient buildings. Couple these designs  \nwith a roll out of clean energy solutions,  \nand prioritise energy efficient appliances  \nand retrofitting. \nMANUFACTURED GOODS\nManufacturing makes the world go round: we need \nit to produce vehicles, clothing, appliances and \nequipment. Its contribution to the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries is far from negligible: it is \nresponsible for about one-third of global GHG \nemissions, and around 5% of global freshwater \nand land use . The sector boasts a large material \nfootprint—and similarly produces substantial \namounts of industrial waste.\nHere, circular solutions must tackle the full value \nchain, but material demand must also shrink: \nthis will necessitate a societal shift to favouring \nsufficiency over excess and reducing consumption \nto sustainable levels. Our four key solutions for \nmanufactured goods are:\nMAINSTREAM INDUSTRIAL \nSYMBIOSIS AND EFFICIENCY\nAchieve process improvements, scrap \ndiversion and reduction in yield losses \nthrough greater industrial symbiosis and \nefficiency. Foster tighter collaboration within \nand between industries to deliver powerful \nmaterial and emissions savings.\nESCHEW FAST FASHION IN FAVOUR \nOF SUSTAINABLE TEXTILES\nDrastically reducing new clothing purchases, \nall used clothing should go on to be repaired, \nreused or, if needed, recycled appropriately. \nPrioritise natural and local textile \nmanufacturing, as well as higher-quality and \nmore durable garments.\nBUY WHAT’S NEEDED\nReduce the purchases of common electronic \ngoods, appliances and other equipment to \nsufficiency levels.\nEXTEND THE LIFETIME OF \nMACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND \nGOODS\nMaximising the lifetime of goods that serve \nour daily needs can bring a number of \nenvironmental benefits.\n29\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n28\n\n\nDIFFERENT COUNTRIES, \nDIFFERENT PRIORITIES  \nWhile true systems change implies a holistic \napproach, exploring the economic character \nof each of the world’s regions and how they \ndevelop over time allows us to identify the most \nimpactful material flows and sectors. Despite \nclear divergences between countries, we can still \ndiscern which circular economy interventions will \nbe most suitable in certain contexts based on clear \ncommon needs and structural parallels. We have \nused the country profiles Build , Grow and Shift —first \ndeveloped in the Circularity Gap Report 2020 25—to \nselect the most relevant two key systems and two \ncircular solutions for countries to focus on. \n1. BUY WHAT YOU NEED AND  \nEXTEND THE LIFETIME OF \nMACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND \nGOODS. \nExceeding their fair share of material use, 26 \nthese countries are responsible for the \nbulk of ecological overshoot. 27 Demand for \nraw materials and finished goods—largely \nimported from Grow  countries—means they \noften offshore environmental impacts. Shift  \ncountries must rethink their consumption \npatterns and transform their lifestyles, \neschewing consumerism in favour of \nsufficiency-based approaches. 28\n2. MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT \nALREADY EXISTS AND  PRIORITISE \nCIRCULAR MATERIALS AND \nAPPROACHES.\nIn 2018, stock build-up alone represented \n40% of Shift  countries’ material footprint. \nThis would increase even more if we were to \ninclude materials used to operate buildings \npost-construction—those used for heating \nand cooling, for example. Applying circular \nsolutions to the already built-up built \nenvironment will therefore be a key lever to \nreduce Shift  countries’ impact. \nSHIFT COUNTRY PROFILE\nThese countries are home to around a quarter of \nthe global population, yet consume over one-third \n(34%) of raw materials. \nShift  countries’ material footprint per capita is 4.6 \ntimes that of Build  countries (largely due to the \noverconsumption of consumer goods imported \nfrom Grow counties) and 1.6 times that of Grow \ncountries.\nThese are high-income countries in the Global \nNorth, as well as in the Gulf, Australia and \nOceania. Examples include Member States of the \nEU, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada and Argentina.\nWhile much of their infrastructure is already \nbuilt, they still contribute heavily to the \novershoot of planetary boundaries:  they \ncontribute 42% of climate change, 27% of \nnitrogen, 18% of phosphorus, 16% of freshwater \nuse and 38% of land use change.\nKey development pathways: High-income Shift \ncountries on average enjoy affluent, comfortable \nlifestyles and perform well on social indicators—\nbut they consume far more than their fair share \nof materials. While they house a minority of the \nworld’s population, they generate close to half \nof global emissions and consume the most (per \ncapita) across all material groups. These countries \nmust focus on reducing material extraction and \nuse to lighten their environmental burden.\nTo achieve the above, the most impactful circular solutions \nacross Manufactured goods and the Built environment are:\nPOPULATION RAW MATERIAL CONSUMPTION\n31\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n30\n\n\n1. MAINSTREAM REGENERATIVE \nAGRICULTURE AND  GO LOCAL , \nSEASONAL AND ORGANIC.\nAs Grow countries constitute half of the \nworld’s population, they are important food \nconsumer30 and are also the globe’s biggest \nproducers. As well as increased meat and \nprocessed food consumption, food waste \nis also on the rise, especially in the post-\nconsumer stage. 31 \n2. EXTEND THE LIFETIME OF \nMACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND \nGOODS AND  MAINSTREAM \nINDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS AND \nEFFICIENCY.\nDecades of rapid, export-driven \nindustrialisation and low-cost labour have \nmade their mark on these countries: now, \ntransforming their manufacturing systems \nwill be key to reducing environmental impacts \nwhile advancing social progress. They account \nfor around half of the raw materials used \nannually—often driven by demand from \nwealthier nations. \nGROW COUNTRY PROFILE\nGrow countries globally account for 55% of all \nraw material extraction and 52% of the material \nfootprint, while housing around 37% of the global \npopulation.\nThese are larger Southeast Asian countries and \ncountries in Latin America and Northern Africa, \nas well as those with an economy in transition in \nEastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. \nExamples include China, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, \nVietnam, Myanmar and Egypt.\nLarge contribution to the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries—largely due to the \nconsumptions of local materials in higher-\nincome (Shift ) countries:  these countries \ncontribute 50% of climate change, 62% of \nnitrogen, 60% of phosphorus, 53% of freshwater \nuse and 42% of land use change. \nKey development pathways: Largely middle-\nincome, Grow countries need to continue growing \nto meet their peoples’ needs, but in a way that \nis much more sensitive to the various planetary \nboundaries. Increased growth and income levels \nhave led to a nutrition transformation: diets are \nincreasingly shifting in favour of more animal-\nbased proteins—such as meat and dairy—and \nprocessed foods. 29 While many countries are and \nwill likely remain key manufacturing and industrial \nhubs for the rest of the world’s—and their own—\nconsumption, this necessitates a shift to make this \nsustainable environmentally and supportive and \nsafe for workers.\nTo achieve the above, the most impactful circular solutions \nacross the Food system and Manufactured goods are:\n1. MAINSTREAM REGENERATIVE \nAGRICULTURE AND  PUT HEALTHIER \nAND SATIATING FOODS FIRST. \nBuild countries’ food systems are an \nimportant lever to create environmental, \nsocial and economic benefits. The countries’ \neconomies are largely agricultural-based, \nwith biomass accounting for nearly half of \ntheir total material consumption. Agriculture \nclaims a large share of employment: four to \nsix out of ten people are employed by the \nsector. 32,33 \n2. PRIORITISE CIRCULAR MATERIALS \nAND APPROACHES AND  REUSE \nWASTE.\nThe continued build-up of housing and \ninfrastructure in Build countries—to \naccommodate their growing and urbanising \npopulations—represents an opportunity \nto leverage circular solutions for better \nenvironmental and social outcomes. \nUnchecked urbanisation and the resulting \nurban sprawl of informal settlements is \noften linked to poverty, contaminated water, \nbiodiversity loss, and more. Currently, almost \none-third of urban residents live in slum \nhouseholds. 34 \nTo achieve the above, the most impactful circular solutions \nacross the Food system and the Built environment are:\nBUILD COUNTRY PROFILE\nBuild countries consume 13% of the global \nmaterial footprint, while they account for almost \n50% of the population.\nCountries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia \nsuch as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan \nand the Philippines, and some small island states, \nfor example.\nMinimal contribution to the overshoot \nof planetary boundaries: these countries \ncontribute 20% of land use change, 30% of \nfreshwater use, 23% of phosphorus emissions to \nsoil and 11% of nitrogen emissions. \nKey development pathways: As these \ncountries generally struggle to meet basic needs \nfor healthcare and education, their primary \nobjective is to improve living standards. This \nnecessitates increased material use to provide the \ninfrastructure, goods and services that deliver on \nhuman needs. It will also require uplifting workers \nin nations with prevalent informal economies, \nwhich are especially common in the agricultural, \nforestry and waste management sectors. \nRAW MATERIAL CONSUMPTIONPOPULATION\nRAW MATERIAL CONSUMPTIONPOPULATION\n33\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n32\n\n\nHOW TO \nENABLE\nCIRCU-\n      LARITY\n3\nBUILDING RESILIENCE \nIN A DESTABILISED \nWORLD\nUsing circular solutions to reverse the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries sounds simple—but making \ndeep changes across the systems that uphold the \nmodern world is easier said than done. Circular \neconomy is an upgraded operating system that \ncan help tackle the complex and intertwined \nchallenges humanity is facing, if approached well. \nBut to go from theory to action, we must zoom out \nand look at the big picture rather than working in \nsilos: the relationships between each part of the \nsystem must be mapped and new collaborations \nformed. No single department, business, industry, \ncity or nation should work in isolation—and \nno intervention should be applied without \nunderstanding its potential ripple effects. Systems \nthinking shows us the merit of targeting structures \nembedded in a system—such as regulatory \nframeworks and value systems—rather than \ntackling symptoms. In other words, we must tackle \nproblems’ root causes to create lasting change. \nThis Report takes this approach on a global scale. \nIt identifies the most impactful circular solutions \nfor industries across country profiles and shows \nhow legal, regulatory and financial incentives can \nbe shifted to unlock true structural change that \nbenefits people. \nSYSTEMIC CHANGE REQUIRES SYSTEMS \nTHINKING\nToday’s world can be characterised by the ‘polycrisis’: \nthe unfolding of multiple overlapping and interlinked \neconomic, environmental, social and political crises \nand challenges. As these converge, billions of people \naround the globe are impacted on a day-to-day basis. \nTechnology and innovation are often cited as the \nsolutions to climate and environmental challenges. \nWhile necessary, they in and of themselves cannot \ntackle the multidimensional challenges of ecological \nbreakdown. This is partly because of rebound effects \nstemming from efficiency gains that actually increase \ntotal material use, 35 but also because they are typically \none-dimensional and reactive, solving a specific issue \nbut failing to adapt the incentive structures required to \ninfluence entire systems. The challenge of the century \nwill be to tackle these crises in an integrated manner: \na systems-thinking approach can tackle complexity, \ndeal with uncertainty, balance trade-offs, limit rebound \neffects and prevent embedding biases that can cause \nissues down the line. \nSystems thinking must inform how we roll \nout circular economy solutions. This involves \nidentifying root causes, key leverage points and \nsystemic enablers, thereby shifting incentives:\n1. Uncover root causes. We have to tackle the \nproblem itself, not the symptom. Bringing \nhuman activity back within a safe operating \nspace will require us to address the root causes \nof ecological breakdown—namely excessive \nmaterial use, which has been supercharged \nby consumerism, the quantity of waste and \npollution released, and the damage dealt to the \nplanet’s ecosystems.\n2. Identify leverage points. These are spots \nin a system—be it a business, economy, city \nor ecosystem—where one small shift can \ntrigger transformative change. 36 By using \ncircular solutions to fine-tune the structures \ninfluencing our perceptions, motivations and \nbehaviour, we can spur true systems change.\n3. Determine systemic enablers.  Systems \nchange won’t happen without political and \nfinancial backing—nor without the support \nof the workforce. Here, active government \nsupport for deep transformation will play a key \nrole by changing ‘the rules of the game’ and \n‘levelling the playing field’ to enable equitable \ncircular solutions.\nUltimately, shifting incentives.  Bringing the three \npoints above together can help us shift incentives \nand encourage actors to rethink how materials, \nfinance, knowledge and skills flow through their \neconomies. By doing so, we can accelerate \nprogress towards a global circular economy \nthat improves wellbeing without overshooting \nplanetary boundaries. Shifting incentives is crucial \nto changing behaviour and ultimately preventing \nmaterial use from spiralling further. \n34\n35\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n\nPOLICY, FINANCE AND \nPEOPLE\nSuccessful systemic change hinges on support \nfrom governments, financial actors, businesses and \ncitizens alike: connecting policies and laws, capital \nand business models and people will be crucial to the \ncircular transition. \nPolicy encompasses the rules, guidelines and laws  \nset by governments that have the power to shape  \nthe actions of citizens, businesses and whole \neconomies alike. Policies and legal frameworks  \n‘set the rules of the game’, and can incentivise  \nsustainable and circular practices while penalising \nharmful ones, thereby shaping the nature and scale \nof economic activities across industries and nations. \nIn many cases, however, enforcing legislation  \nremains a challenge: monitoring and penalties  \nmust be strict enough that individuals and  \nbusinesses play by the rules.\nFinance is the lifeblood of the economy. Financial \nflows—managed by powerful financial institutions—\ndetermine which ideas are realised, and which \nactivities and businesses are funded and scaled. \nFinancing is necessary for circular solutions to replace \nlinear practices, and should particularly be directed \nat activities that bring about positive impact, such \nas cuts to virgin material use and the provision of \ndecent work. Furthermore, addressing key systemic \nlevers—such as the uptake of consistent circular \nassessment metrics, environmental fiscal reform, \ntrue-cost accounting, alleviating the debt burden and \ntransforming multilateral financing institutions—will \nbenefit all.\nPeople are key agents and beneficiaries of change: \ntheir skills, jobs, awareness and choices can help to \nachieve systemic change and will be impacted by \nactions taken. Many things—such as policy, finance, \neducation, migration, and the current state of the \neconomy—influence people’s livelihoods and the \nlabour market. These factors impact how people’s \nskills are used, and how income and opportunities \nare distributed across and within societies. Aligning \nlaws, flows of capital and opportunities for people \nwith circular economy principles creates a powerful \nsynergy, ultimately allowing us to shift away from our \ntake-make-waste mode of operation in a way that \nworks with and for people. \nCONNECTING THE DOTS TO UNLOCK \nSYSTEMIC CHANGE\nAlthough public policy has the power to shift priorities \nand ultimately redefine the ‘rules of the game’, so that \nthey facilitate—rather than restrict—the transition, the \nincreasingly financialised economic system 37 has limited \ngovernment's ability to enact change, allocate funds and \ndirect spending to necessary capital-intensive green \ninvestment—from green infrastructure development \nto welfare schemes, particularly in Build and Grow \ncountries. 38 In this system, countries’ GDP and national \nwealth (and debt) can rise, while environmental stability \nand human wellbeing erode. \nTo maximise the environmental, social and economic \npotential of the circular economy, governments must \nactively support mission-driven innovation, redesign \nmarkets to maximise public value creation, align on \npurpose-driven strategies and reduce inequality to \nuphold social cohesion. While there has been a rise \nin circular economy-related policymaking, 39 more \nconcerted efforts are needed from governments to \nredefine the goal of the economy and put powerful \nincentives in place that can truly foster systemic \nchange. This fundamental role of capital in the circular \ntransition especially highlights the importance of public \nfinance. In many countries, significant targeted public \ninvestment remains the crucial first step to developing \nthe capacity, infrastructure and know-how to implement \ncircular economy solutions at scale. Entrepreneurial \nstates and development banks 40 are best suited to take \non this task, ensuring ‘value’ is redefined to go beyond \nfinance and also consider returns in natural, social and \nhuman capital.\nInternational financial institutions and governments \nalso have an important role in mainstreaming circular \nmodels, and incentivising private finance to engage with \nprojects and businesses that minimise resource demand \nand that actively keep materials in use for as long as \npossible. One of the main problems with the existing \neconomic paradigm, however, is that the economics \njust don’t work for making the global economy \noperate within planetary boundaries: environmental \nand social harms (so-called ‘negative externalities’) \nare not factored into prices, and this heavily favours \ninvestments in the linear businesses that extract \nand pollute as means to keep costs down and profits \nup. While this is a pricing issue, it stems from policy \ndecisions. Finance and policy  must work in tandem \nto level this playing field for circular solutions. Policy \nmust set the right incentives in place to channel private \ncapital towards desired activities, so that finance can \npractically enable and accelerate the transition.* \nLast but certainly not least, the labour market  is a \npivotal lever for driving the circular economy transition \nby harnessing a country's national competencies, \nknowledge and skills. To maximise this, circular \nprinciples can be integrated into education, strategies \nfor workforce development, and forecasting within \nthe labour market: the circular economy will be labour \nintensive, especially in certain sectors, and it will \nrequire re- and up-skilling huge numbers of people. \nThis comprehensive approach can ensure a synergistic \nrelationship between the circular economy and the \nlabour market, fostering sustainable and decent \nlivelihoods. \nTo bring circular interventions to life around the world, \nit will be key to uncover the people, skills and roles \npivotal for success, while crucially accounting for \natypical forms of work—temporary, flexible or informal \nwork, for example—and considering the interplay of \nsocial equity and gender dynamics that impact decent \nwork outcomes. If the circular transition is managed \nequitably and effectively, it can positively impact the \nlabour market by providing new job opportunities, \nraising job standards and reducing inequalities through \na global redistribution of value and opportunities. To \neffectively transition to a circular economy, however, \nit's crucial to better understand the trade-offs and \ndynamics inherent in the labour market to help craft \nstrategies that manage or mitigate challenges that \nmight crop up during the transition. For example, \nby addressing inevitable job losses in transitioning \nindustries or shifting trade relationships. \nPUTTING POLICY, FINANCE AND PEOPLE TO \nWORK ACROSS COUNTRY PROFILES\nUnlocking and realising circular economy solutions \nwill require systemic enablers that can overcome \nchallenges specific to different country profiles and \nsystems. It’s important to recognise that the three \nenablers of policy, finance and people are not isolated \nfrom each other—they are deeply intertwined. Each \nfaces its own barriers in each country profile, and in \neach system. For example, while Shift  countries enjoy \navailable capital and space to develop cutting-edge \npolicies, many Build  and some Grow  countries are \nbound by less access to financial resources, a huge \ndebt burden 41 and a lack of autonomous policy space. \nFor this reason, a different mix of enablers across \npolicy, finance and society will be needed to kickstart \naction in each country profile and system.\n* Ultimately, the goal will be to redefine the regulatory and fiscal \nframework to ensure that circular investments become the first-best \nsolutions for private investors, based on their risk-return credentials. This \nwill involve reduced interest rates for sustainable activities to develop \nlocal markets and lower the risks for private finance to engage.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT\nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n37\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n36\n\n\nSHIFT\nCOUNTRIES\n4\nCIRCULARITY IN\nRADICALLY \nREDUCE MATERIAL \nCONSUMPTION AND \nUPHOLD WELLBEING\nSETTING THE SCENE\nOverconsumption in high-income countries is \nthe main driver behind planetary overshoot and \necological breakdown. 42 Shift countries may enjoy \nhigh general HDI scores, but they operate far \nbeyond the planet’s means. It is estimated that if \nevery person were to live and consume like the US, \nfor example, we would need five Earths to sustain \nour population. 43 At the same time, despite the \nrelatively comfortable lifestyles enjoyed, Shift \ncountries have failed to eliminate social shortfalls \nin many ways. For example, the gap between rich \nand poor is only widening: 44 in Organisation for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \ncountries, (a group almost exclusively composed of \nShift nations) income inequality is the highest it’s \nbeen for the past half a century. 45 This trend has \naccelerated as the cost of living crisis continues. 46\nWhile these countries have stricter domestic \nenvironmental regulations and advanced waste \nmanagement systems, they drive significant \nenvironmental degradation in the rest of the world. 47 \nDemand from Shift  countries sparks extraction and \npollution elsewhere—and these wealthy nations \noutsource industrial production to countries with \nweaker environmental and social regulations. Build  \nand Grow countries are highly dependent on the \nexport of the raw materials—while on the other hand, \nthey also frequently import Shift  countries’ waste. All \nthese dynamics impact the way in which resources \n(and capital) flow between countries, 48 and influence \nthe type of economic activities and job opportunities \ncommon to each country profile. As new industrial \npolicies are introduced to reshape these inequality \ndynamics, it’s crucial that place-sensitive policy \npackages are rolled out to mitigate potential job losses \nin more ‘linear’ sectors and address regional disparities \nwithin and across Shift  countries, as well as their \npartner Build and Grow  countries.\nShift  countries are characterised by a rapidly ageing \nworkforce. This is taking its toll on key industries, \nsuch as construction and manufacturing, for \nwhich young new talent is lacking: these industries \noften fail to attract talent as new entrants \nto the labour market increasingly move into \nknowledge worker roles. Other trends—such \nas automation and outsourcing—are sparking \neconomic concerns and job insecurities across \nindustries, from manufacturing and transport to \ntrade and finance. 49 Advanced service industries \nin Shift  countries also bring challenges: these \nindustries are often highly precarious due to \npart-time, flexible contracts and informal working \nrelationships are prevalent. These roles often \nattract lower-educated, young people and those \nwith migrant backgrounds, posing greater risks to \nthese groups. \n39\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n38\n\n\nSYST EM ONE: B UILD \nA CIRCULA R BUILT \nENVIRONMEN T\nWhat could a circular built environment look like in \nShift countries?\nShift  countries have already built up much of their \nbuildings and infrastructure: so here, circular solutions \ncentre on making the most of what already exists. In \na circular future, buildings are repurposed, renovated \nand retrofitted rather than demolished, meaning that \nfar fewer materials are used to provide housing or \ncommercial spaces. Through adaptive reuse principles, \nabandoned buildings are given new life, and heritage \nsites are carefully preserved through structural \nupgrades, for example. \nAll of these processes make use of the most circular \nmaterials possible: locally-sourced, renewable and \nsecondary. Where building new is necessary, circular \ndesign strategies are the gold standard—from material \nlightweighting to biomimicry. Nature’s inspirational \nsolutions are used to influence building design and \neven act as a muse for material innovation: cutting-\nedge innovations like bendable concrete—inspired by \nthe chemical structure of abalone shells—are used \nto cut material use while maintaining strength and \ndurability, for example. 50 Buildings are designed for \nrepairability and deconstruction, so that components \nand materials can be easily reused in the future, and \nwith a focus on energy efficiency. These low-carbon \nbuildings of the future are also seamlessly connected \nto renewable energy sources. Circular construction is \nthe norm thanks to heavy public support, with policies, \nincentives and fiscal mechanisms making sustainability \nworth developers’ while. \nBuilt environment workers in Shift  countries benefit \nfrom circularity, too: workers have been well-prepared \nfor the change in job profiles, with harmonised training \nsystems across the EU, for example, equipping workers \nwith the necessary skills for success: 51 think Building \nInformation Management (BIM) systems and 3D \nprinting, for example. Decent working conditions are \na reality for all, including migrant workers, who have \npreviously been at higher risk for workplace injuries \nand are more likely to be employed under short-\nterm contracts. With labour shortages already rife \nin construction industries in Shift  countries, circular \neconomy interventions need to include measures that \nincrease the quality and attractiveness of these roles.\nWhat could a circular built environment look like in \nShift countries?\nWe envision a circular future for the built environment in \nShift  countries, in which design, construction, operation \nand end-of-use management work in synergy to deliver \nhighly resource efficient buildings and infrastructure in a \nfully closed-loop system. Unlocking this vision, however, \nwill require concerted action across policy, finance, \nand the labour market. Some of the key components of \nunlocking this vision include the following:\nReward market players for investing in circular \nsolutions and business models\nMany actors in the built environment aim to adopt \ncircular business models but lack the regulatory signals \nand economic incentives to do so. A policy environment \nthat carefully mixes regulations and rewards for market \nplayers is key to (dis)incentivising innovation in business \npractices across the entire built environment value \nchain. \n• Implement strict regulations that prioritise \nrenovation, retrofitting and adaptive reuse \nwherever possible, and require the high-value \nrecycling and reuse of construction and demolition \nwaste. This could include mandating adaptive reuse \nand renovation for existing structures, rolling out \npenalties for landfilled or incinerated waste and \napplying minimum requirements for secondary \nmaterial reuse in renovation and lifetime extension \nprojects. This would interrupt the cycle of demolishing \nand building new, which is a key barrier to maximising \nthe value of what already exists for as long as \npossible.\n• Develop effective certifications and warranties \nfor secondary materials  to validate their safety \nand quality, and make it much easier for contractors \nto comply with building regulations when using \nthese materials. This effort could be combined with \nstrengthened environmental requirements for \nimported materials to mitigate the use of high-impact \nvirgin materials that have been produced in locations \nwith less stringent standards. These efforts in tandem \ncan help incentivise builders and developers to make \nmore sustainable material choices. 52 The skills and \nknowledge needed to adhere to these certifications \nmust be integrated into Vocational Education and \nTraining (VET) and in-work training.\n• Roll out standards and criteria for circularity  \nthroughout public procurement, zoning and spatial \nplanning guidelines. Bold targets can be set to \ndecrease buildings’ and infrastructure’s embodied \ncarbon, next to mandating material passports and \ntargets for secondary or bio-based material use. \nNormalising circular economy practices throughout \nbuilding regulations creates demand in the market \nfor companies to invest in and compete on circular \neconomy approaches.\n• Roll out innovative land ownership models, such \nas Community Land Trusts, to ensure affordable \nlong-term housing for communities—homes should \nnot be treated like a financial asset first, and a \nplace to live second. 53 Regulatory, technical and \nfinancial instruments like the restriction of foreign \ninvestment in housing can be tailored so that \nbuildings are used more appropriately. Improved \naccess to financing for cooperative housing, or the \nright to first refusal can ensure that buildings are \nused efficiently. 54\nMake circular building projects an attractive \ninvestment option\nWorking in synergy with the stricter policy \nenvironment that is described above, it is crucial to \nexpand the flow of capital and investment toward \ncompanies who take the risks to transition toward \nmore circular models. The barrier of risk aversion must \nbe fully overcome in order to transition the sector to a \nmore circular model.\n• Financially incentivise circular construction  \nby cutting property taxes for buildings that meet \ncircular criteria, providing tax credits for circular \nmaterial use or reducing insurance premiums for \ncircular buildings or infrastructure. Additional \nfinancial support can be provided through \nsubsidies and grants that encourage the application \nof circular business models, or experimental \nmaterials and building techniques. Mission-driven \nfinancial mechanisms such as green bonds or \nsustainability-linked low-interest loans can make \ncircular initiatives more financially attractive for \nlarge developers.\n• Establish a common language amongst \nstakeholders in the financial and building \nsectors  to boost transparency and enable better \ncollaboration. This is already taking place in the \nEU. For example, the EU Taxonomy, Corporate \nSustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), \nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) \nand labelling of circular built environment projects \nthrough initiatives such as Level(s) are all important \nsteps in this direction. This is because they \nconsolidate the assessment and reporting of the \nsustainable performance of construction activities \nand buildings across their entire lifecycle.\n• Rethink accounting standards and practices  \nto better capture the value of built assets, frame \nwaste as a resource so that no building depreciates \nalong a linear pathway, and acknowledge the \npositive benefits of long-term social, environmental \nand economic impacts for investment. This could \nalso include the revision of building regulations \nto accurately reflect the depreciation of various \nbuilding components. Buildings don’t depreciate \nas a whole—some parts wear out faster than \nothers: furniture and facades, for example, have \nmuch shorter useful lives than building structures. \nAccurately capture this difference to boost the long-\nterm value of building projects. 55\nClose the labour and skills gap with a mix of \neducation and policy \nDespite having a highly skilled workforce, critical \nknowledge and skills gaps persist in the building sector. \nThis must be tackled to deliver circular solutions at \nscale. This presents a number of opportunities, such \nas bringing more women into the workforce, training \nmigrant workers, and increasing workers’ safety—all of \nwhich remain challenges in this sector today.\n•   Address labour shortages in the industry by \naligning policy and increasing the attractiveness \nof jobs. Construction industries across Shift  \ncountries face persistent labour and skills shortages \nthat are increasing with ageing societies and \nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT\nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n41\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n40\n\n\nworsened by the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. \nAlthough greening the construction industry may \nincrease the attractiveness of these occupations, it \nwill not be enough to overcome existing shortages. \nEfforts to increase the quality of jobs, through better \nwages, working conditions, social protection and \nskills development are needed to bolster the right \ntypes of jobs and with them circular practices in the \nindustry.\n• Support the development of necessary circular \nskills in the labour market by including the \ncircular economy in Technical and Vocational \nEducation and Training (TVET) curricula,  lifelong \nlearning systems and workplace training. Public \ntraining services  can be offered to workers within \nthe construction sector, along with income support \nduring unemployment and effective re-employment \nservices to support smooth and effective re-\nintegration for jobseekers. \n• Review and (re)formulate skills development \npolicies,  especially for the validation and \nrecognition of skills and qualifications for migrant \nand more informal workers. Such an approach \nwould address local shortages of workers and \nprovide greater mobility to workers who can bring \nthe necessary skills that deliver circular approaches \nwithin the construction sector through tools like \nskills passports. 56\nHAFENCITY, A FORMER INDUSTRIAL \nBROWNFIELD SITE TURNED \nINCLUSIVE ‘CITY-WITHIN-A-CITY’ \nIS A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT. \nLike many European cities, Hamburg faces \nchallenges tied to rapid urban growth, \ndensity and lack of affordable housing. \nGentrification has led to increased rents, \nrising inequalities and the displacement of \nlong-time residents. In an effort to combat \nthe increasing demand for housing and \noffices while anticipating flood risks, the city \ndecided to redevelop its former port into a \nnew urban district: HafenCity.\nIn the early 2000s, the City of Hamburg \nlaunched one of the biggest inner-city \nregeneration projects yet.  The objective \nwas to extend Hamburg’s downtown area by \n40%, create inner-city access to the shores of \nthe Elbe and provide additional housing for \nthe city’s growing population. 57 The process \nfollowed the concept of urban regeneration , \nwhich connects the stimulation of economic \nactivities and environmental improvements \nwith wider social and cultural aspects. 58 \nWhile several urban regeneration projects \nhave made ground in the EU over the last \nfew years, HafenCity’s scale and ambition \nset it apart. HafenCity is built on a former \nindustrial port area and effectively reuses \nexisting infrastructure and land.  Its \nhistoric warehouses have been preserved \nand converted into mixed-use spaces, such \nas offices, restaurants and apartments, \nextending the life of these structures. What’s \nmore, the City of Hamburg negotiated \ncomplete site control from the start, \nwhich allowed it to counter conventional \npractices concerning building designs \nand technologies, land use synergies and \nenvironmental amenities and performance. \nTo achieve such high environmental and \nsocial objectives, HafenCity relied on a \nspecific public-private governance model, \nHafenCityHamburg GmbH . A GmbH, or \n‘Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung ’ is a \nlimited liability company. The partnership \ncombines the efficiency of the private \nsector (market discipline and mechanisms) \nwith the benefits of public direction and \nlegitimacy. 59 This entailed a clear division \nof responsibilities between public owners \nand private managers to avoid short-term \npartisan politics. The city developed \nambitious tendering processes that \nfavoured quality over price.  HafenCity \nHamburg GmbH drives development \nconcepts that support a socially balanced \nmix of apartments—one-third of which \nare reserved for low and medium-income \nhouseholds—good architecture, urban \ndesign and energy efficiency. \nIn terms of mobility, the city prioritises \nsmart solutions with walking, cycling and \npublic transport, substantially reducing \ncar ownership.  To further reduce reliance \non fossil fuels, the city relies on green \nheating power for high energy efficiency, \nreduced CO 2 emissions and lower energy \nbills. All the buildings in HafenCity must be \nconnected to two district heating networks, \nfor example. Compared to a conventional \nfossil fuel heat supply, by 2028, a minimum of \n75,000 tonnes of CO 2 will be saved. For each \nsubsequent year, an additional 12,000 tonnes \nwill be saved.\nIf that wasn’t enough, the city also \ndeveloped Germany’s first cradle-to-\ncradle design residential project, the \nMoringa project. 60 It is the healthiest high-\nrise building to ever have been constructed \nin Germany, with half the materials used \ncoming from secondary sources and \nboasting maximal green space. Hamburg \nembeds sustainable design throughout \nthe city, requiring all renovation and \nnew building projects to have eco-labels \ncertifying environmental sustainability \nin construction.  The DNG special aware \nlabel, launched in 2022, is focused on \ncircular construction methods: the use of \nregenerative raw materials such as timber \nand clay, carbon-reduced steel, recycled \nbuilding materials and modular or reduced-\nconcrete construction methods. It also places \nan important focus on the documentation \nof the materials used and their separability \nduring deconstruction to favour their \nrecycling and reuse potential. 61\nThe project is set to be completed by 2030, \nat which time HafenCity will house 15,000 \nresidents, 5,000 students and create up to \n45,000 jobs. HafenCity is a model for other \ncities implementing circular and socially \nsustainable development concepts. The \nsetup of HafenCity Hamburg GmbH as an \nautonomous subsidiary helped to avoid \ncumbersome and lengthy planning processes \nand red tape. The ambitious tendering \nprocess has allowed both the city and its \nstakeholders to achieve their objectives, \ncreating a diversified urban and social \nfabric while upholding strong standards for \nreusing what existed by applying eco-design \nprinciples. \nCircular, socially sustainable \npublic procurement holds \nstrong potential for setting \nhigh standards and driving \nchange. We can source \ngreener, more sustainable \nproducts and services while \nsupporting local employment, \nin fair and decent conditions.\nJuliette Moizo, French Ministry of \nEnvironment\n43\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n42\n\n\nSYST EM TWO: ADVANCE \nCIRCULAR MANUFACTURING\nWhat could circular manufacturing look like in Shift  \ncountries?\nIn a circular future, Shift countries have embraced a \nshift in values that has redefined their relationship \nwith the material world. Here, consumption is guided \nby an appreciation for nature and its resources, with \nconsumerism a thing of the past. Schools pass this \nethos on to younger generations, who are taught to \ncare for and repair their belongings from primary \neducation, while advertising extols the charm of the \nwell-used over the allure of the new. Consuming less \nbut cherishing more, Shift societies enjoy lifestyles \nmarked by quality and connection rather than quantity \nand consumption.\nConsumer goods are made to last, too: fast fashion \nis replaced by durable, easy-to-mend and recyclable \nclothing, while electronics are designed for \nrepairability and upgradability, with robust ‘right to \nrepair’ laws ensuring access to parts and services. \nBusinesses play a positive role in society by offering \nservices like repair, rental and second-hand sales, \nwith take-back schemes making it simple to give their \nproducts a second life. Instead of tossing their items at \nend-of-use, citizens also swap, share or upcycle their \nclothing, electronics, furniture and appliances. This \nis all backed by supportive government policies and \ncommunity-based initiatives—such as clothing banks, \ntool ‘libraries’ and repair cafés—that make circular \nbehaviour as convenient as possible. \nIn this circular future, workers in the manufacturing \nsector have been well prepared for changes in their \njob profiles, and are increasingly trained in upgrading, \nrepairing, refurbishing and remanufacturing products, \nas well as how to market and sell services as well \nas products. Jobs in recycling, reverse logistics and \nsecondary markets have also risen, as well as good \nquality jobs in service sectors.\nHow can we unlock this vision in Shift  countries?\nShift  countries need to scale down socially unnecessary \nproduction and consumption and focus on activities \nthat uphold wellbeing. Curbing overconsumption will \nrequire a comprehensive mix of policy instruments \nto inspire action, reduce existing barriers and shift \nmindsets. The keys to unlocking this vision include, but \nare not limited to:\nEncourage products to be designed for \ncircularity: durable, and easy to reuse, repair \nand recycle \nConstructing an ecosystem of complementary \nand supporting regulations is crucial to the wide \nscale adoption of circular business models and to \nencourage the uptake of new ownership models, \nsuch as Product-as-a-Service and Peer-to-Peer \nproduct-sharing platforms. 62 \n• Strengthen universal Right to Repair \nlegislation and Extended Producer \nResponsibility, 63 which require manufacturers \nto provide spare parts, tools and repair manuals \nto their customers and repair shops. Ensure \nlegislation puts repair before replacement, \nprovides data for the open-source production \nof spare parts and removes software barriers to \nrepair.64\n• Set standards for material efficiency and \nproduct durability,  especially for electronics \nand appliances. Prohibit planned obsolescence \nand incentivise repair, recycling and reuse \nto extend product lifetimes. This could also \nbe extended to include setting targets for \nmaterial use reduction  that progressively \nand rapidly decline until sustainable levels are \nreached at the needed speed, scope and scale, \nand banning the destruction of unsold or \nreturned goods , banning waste exports and \nintroducing liability for waste export violations \nto lessen waste generation. Require regular \nmaintenance for goods —such as capital \nequipment—to ensure value is retained for  \nas long as possible.\nUse pricing and convenience to nudge people \ntoward sufficiency lifestyles\nPricing and convenience help people make better \nchoices. Making circular products and services more \naffordable and cost-effective is crucial to encourage \nconsumers to adopt less materialistic lifestyles and \nmore sustainable consumption patterns, making \nthe transition to a sufficiency-centred lifestyle both \nfeasible and attractive.\n• Stimulate demand-oriented shifts  that \nencourage lifestyle changes and reduce barriers \nto repairing, refurbishing, remanufacturing and \nrecycling products, both for consumers and \nindustries. This could include developing an \nenvironmental ‘score’ for all products to be \nincluded on labels,  and banning the advertising \nof high-impact goods and services,  from fast \nfashion to air travel. This could be realised in a \nvariety of ways such as restricting advertising \nin public places and to children or establishing \ncommercial-free zones and times. \n• Apply more progressive taxation and heavier \ninheritance and wealth taxes  to curb excessive \nwealth and income inequality and reduce the \noverconsumption of luxury goods. 65\n• Provide consumers with financial incentives \nsuch as bonus cheques, or reduced or zero tax on \nrepair services and refurbished goods, that allow \nthem to easily repair their goods or shop second-\nhand.66 These incentives could be quite targeted \ntowards specific consumer goods like fast-fashion \nand electronics. \n• Governments may also consider taxing \nmaterial extraction rather than labour. 67  \nThis would require broad stakeholder  \nengagement between actors in academia,  \nthe private sector and financial institutions to \nsupport research and scale pilot projects that \nadvance ‘true cost’ pricing. 68\nFoster a cultural shift where sustainability is \nthe norm and sufficiency mindsets prevail\nUltimately, the entrenchment of consumerism \nand linear production-consumption patterns \nin contemporary culture and social norms \nunderscores the necessity of a paradigm shift, \nwhere values, attitudes and behaviours are \nrealigned to embrace circularity and sufficiency.\n• Invest in and use just transition funds to \ninvest in skills development, education and \ntraining. 69 In particular, support regions with \nhistorically extraction-focused economies in \n(re)training their workers and youth to prepare \nthem for a circular future. Public education \nshould also be shaped so that necessary skills, \nknowledge, and problem-solving abilities are \nembedded in all forms of education. This will \nserve to influence both career choices and \nconsumer behaviour.\n• Roll out Job Guarantees and explore reducing \nthe standard work week to gradually break \nthe ‘work and spend’ cycle and foster a less \nmaterialistic, more relational and participatory \nsociety. Promote Job Guarantee programmes as \na way of increasing green jobs while reducing \nunemployment, poverty and income inequality. 70, \n71 Support social dialogue as a way of improving \nworkers’ rights and acquiring better and safe \nworking conditions within green sectors. 72 \n• Roll out awareness-raising campaigns to \novercome cultural barriers  to a more circular \nlifestyle. Encourage the practical realisation of \nsuch lifestyles by funding awareness campaigns, \nresponsible advertising and other interventions \nthat promote more sustainable choices and \nreduce stigma related to prolonging the life of or \nsharing consumer goods.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD GETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT BUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n45\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n44\n\n\nThe cost of production is \ndeformed, we are not seeing \nprices reflect the true costs of \nnew goods. True fiscal integrity \nmeans breaking taboos; let's \nshape a system where the cost \nof new goods is transparent, and \nrepair is more appealing than \nreplacing, including through fiscal \nincentives.\nCristina Ganapini, The Restart Project\nPOLICY—SUCH AS THE \nEU’S RIGHT TO REPAIR \nLEGISLATION—CAN BE \nLEVERAGED TO MAKE REPAIR \nTHE NEW NORMAL. \nThe current status quo: products \nthat are made to break and are not \neasily repairable. Now, it’s difficult for \nconsumers to do anything other than \ntrading their broken goods for brand \nnew ones: repair processes are costly \nand complex, and the artificially low \nprices of new products make them the \nmore financially attractive option. This \nproduces mountains of waste: electronic \nwaste (e-waste), for example, is the EU’s \nfastest-growing waste stream—and less \nthan 40% of it is currently recycled. 73 On \na global scale, emissions from e-waste \ngrew by more than 50% between \n2014 and 2020—a figure expected to \nswell to new heights without targeted \nintervention. 74 \nThe EU, however, is tackling this, with \nconsiderable progress over the last \ndecade. Due to active lobbying efforts \nfrom advocacy groups and EU Member \nStates themselves, Right to Repair \nlegislation is emerging: the current \nProposal for a directive on common \nrules promoting the repair of goods, \nfor example, as well as amendments \nto other regulations and directives 75, 76, \n77 that prioritise repair as a remedy \nfor non-conforming products,  so long \nas it’s more affordable than product \nreplacement. The Proposal aims to \nfacilitate this by ensuring consumers \nare up-to-date on producers’ repair \nobligations, setting up online repair \nplatforms for nations to matchmake \nconsumers with retailers and repair \nservices, and determining a European-\nwide quality standard for repairs.  \nIt’s expected that repair will become \nincreasingly easy and attractive for \nconsumers, resulting in cost savings of \naround €176.5 billion over 15 years—\nor around €25 per person per year. 78 \nSocial gains are also expected for EU \nrepair businesses: sales for the sector \nwill largely apply to small- and medium-\nsized enterprises and social enterprises, \ngenerating quality jobs across the \nregion.79 Environmental impacts are \nalso expected to be significant, with \nthe Proposal expected to save 18.4 \nmillion tonnes of CO 2 over 15 years —\nequivalent to the emissions generated \nby a year’s worth of energy use for 2.1 \nmillion homes. While the Proposal has \nyet to be approved, its impact could be \nfavourable—despite concerns relating \nto software barriers, the scope of the \nlegal guarantee and the affordability of \nspare parts, considerations currently not \naddressed in the directive’s text.\nIndividual Member States are already \ntaking this a step further, rolling out a \nrange of policy tools to make repair the \nnew normal: Sweden, for example, has \ncut VAT rates for repair, while Austria, \nGermany and France now offer repair \nbonuses—partial reimbursement \nfor consumers that take this route. \nIn Graz, Austria, both commercial \nand community repair initiatives are \nsupported, with Repair Cafés eligible \nfor yearly funding, while repair bonus \nfunding in Upper Austria saved around \n260 tonnes of e-waste between \nSeptember and December 2019 alone. 80 \nFrance has also rolled out a repairability \nindex for five categories of electronic \ndevices, 81 informing consumers on their \noptions prior to purchase. A mix of both \nhard regulatory tools—such as those \ntargeting manufacturers—and softer \ninstruments that tackle cultural barriers \nand shift consumer attitudes is proving \nremarkably effective: a range of policies \nare needed to promote repair as the way \nforward.\n47\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n46\n\n\nGROW\nCOUNTRIES\nCIRCULARITY IN\nSTABILISE MATERIAL \nCONSUMPTION \nAND SAFEGUARD \nWELLBEING\n5\nSETTING THE SCENE\nMany Grow countries are manufacturing hubs with \nincreasingly well-trained and educated workforces \nand extractive industries organised around their \nnatural resource endowments. Their economies \nare characterised by rapid growth and expansion \nto more diversified economic structures with \ngrowing service and industrial sectors. They are \nalso characterised by increasing trade and global \nmarket integration, improved infrastructure \nand a growing middle class. These countries \nhave benefited from globalisation by becoming \nimportant links in global supply chains, especially \nin labour-intensive sectors like textiles, electronics, \nautomobile manufacturing and other resource-\nintensive industries like steel. They represent \nan increasing share of global economic output \nand are developing fast. That being said, their \neconomic structure is mired by ‘second-generation’ \ndevelopment challenges such as increasing \ncompetitiveness pressures, unsustainable urban \ndevelopment dynamics, ageing populations, rising \nsocial inequality and related disparities, stoking \nsocial discontent and lifestyle diseases.\nToday, many of these nations are rapidly transforming \nfrom low-cost production centres to hubs of innovation \nand high-value-added manufacturing. They offer a \ncombination of cost-competitive labour, improved \ntechnical capabilities and strategic geographic \nlocations, making them attractive for domestic \nmanufacturing and foreign direct investment. Their \ngrowth is supported by investments in education, \nresearch and development, and technology adoption. \nIn particular, digital transformation—also known \nas Industry 4.0—is gaining momentum in Grow  \ncountries. Technologies like the Internet of Things \n(IoT), AI, robotics, 3D printing and data analytics are \nbeing increasingly adopted to improve efficiency, \nflexibility and product quality. Ultimately, inclusive \nand sustainable growth and development in these \ncountries provides positive spillovers across the global \neconomy regarding poverty reduction, sustainable \nlivelihoods, financial stability and cross-border global \nissues such as climate change, energy, food and water \nsecurity, and international trade. \n49\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n48\n\n\nSYST EM ONE: NURTURE A \nCIRCULAR FOOD SYSTEM\nWhat could a circular food system look like in Grow  \ncountries?\nIn the heartlands of Grow  countries, we can imagine a \nnew era of agriculture that merges traditional wisdom \nwith innovation and food production with stewardship \nover ecosystems. Where fast food, unhealthy diets and \nfood waste were once rising, these countries could \nchampion regenerative agriculture centred on people \nand the planet.\nIn this new system, fields are no longer vast \nmonocultures but rather host diverse polycultures \nthat nurture soil, maintain local biodiversity, and yield \nabundant local and seasonal foods. Industrial farms \nhave adopted regenerative practices, and ecosystems \nare regenerated at scale. Protein production has \nbeen reimagined at scale, providing a greater range \nof plant-based options and greatly reducing the \nlevel of industrially reared livestock. This has had a \ntremendously positive impact on the environment, \nclimate and public health. Meanwhile, the workforce \nhas been well-equipped with the relevant skills to \nsupport this transition. Beyond the fields, a network of \nlocal processing units and markets thrives. These hubs \nprioritise minimal processing, ensuring the nutritional \nvalue of food is retained while providing employment \nto many. These hubs also act as centres of innovation, \npioneering techniques to reduce food loss and \ntransform waste.\nWhat’s more, the narrative around consumption \nwould shift dramatically. Urban and rural communities \nsavour predominantly local, seasonal and organic \ndiets. Meals have become a celebration of regional \nflavours, supported by educational campaigns \nunderscoring their health benefits. The public health \nlandscape has been transformed. With diets rich in \ndiverse, organic and fresh ingredients, illnesses such \nas diabetes and obesity have drastically declined. \nMoreover, the emphasis on local and seasonal foods \nmeans that food loss, emissions and environmental \nimpacts are all far lower. In this vision of the future, \nthe circle of life is truly complete: the circular food \nsystem in Grow  countries nurtures nature, and nature, \nin turn, provides nourishment that holistically sustains \ncommunities. \nHow can we unlock this vision in Grow countries? \nWe imagine a resilient, climate-smart and nature-\npositive food system that nurtures Grow countries’ \ncommunities and ecosystems based on legislation that \nis integrated, tailored and aligned with other policies. 82 \nThe keys to unlocking this vision include, but are not \nlimited to:\nRoll out an integrated policy mix to encourage \nnutritious choices and cut food waste\nImplement an integrated policy mix to encourage \nsustainable food consumption based on nutritional \ncontent and environmental impact 83 and to prevent \nand valorise food loss and waste across all stages of \nproduction and consumption. 84, 85  Household income \ngrowth is often followed by rising consumption of \nhigh-impact foods and increased volumes of food loss \nand waste. Policy, finance and public communication \ntools can create structural incentives for consumers to \nchoose nutritious and low-impact options over the long \nterm, and minimise and valorise food loss and waste. \n• Roll out effective market-based incentives tailored \nto consumers that make healthy and sustainable \nfoods the preferred option. This could mean taxes on \nhigh-impact food products, within a broader redesign \nof taxation so that poverty and inequality are not \nexacerbated. Set mandatory public procurement \nstandards —for example, for local, organic, or more \nplant-based food and beverages—to facilitate market \naccess and create a stable market for these products, \nand trigger wider societal behavioural changes. \n• Create an effective regulatory environment, \nincluding advertising sales bans  on certain high-\nimpact food products that threaten human and \nplanetary health—especially ones directed at children \nor placed in public spaces such as hospitals. Make \nfood waste reporting compulsory and strengthen \nstakeholder cooperation to improve the tracking of \nfood losses across the value chain. This can include \nintroducing mandatory legal requirements \nfor strong food waste reduction targets and \nsupporting processes as high as possible in the food \nwaste hierarchy, such as prevention and reuse.\n• Use information-based incentives,  such as food \nlabels with information about food products' \nenvironmental and social impact. Strengthen \neducation and raise awareness with effective \npublic information campaigns to demonstrate \nthe benefits of sustainable agriculture, to subtly \nbut effectively shift conceptions around meat or \n'Western' diets as inspirational and high status \namong the population. Identify and communicate \nthe added value of prevention measures to \nvarious value chain actors.\nUse policy to ensure that financial institutions \ninvest in regenerative farming and circular food\nThe right investment tools and practices must \nbe developed to allow for broad investment in \nregenerative farming and circular food companies \nimplementing circular solutions across the agricultural \nvalue chain. Financial institutions are instrumental \nin driving the economic viability of different business \nmodels and can thus directly influence producers to \ndevelop responsible and transparent supply chains \nand prioritise investments in sustainable agricultural \ncompanies.\n• Policymakers can ensure that the financial \nregulatory environment supports  long-term \ntransformation by introducing transparency \nrequirements. This will help ensure that companies’ \nlobbying activities  comply with their public \nstatements, and contribute to fully traceable \nsupply chains  where companies are responsible \nfor upholding strict sustainability standards and \nhuman and labour rights across. These frameworks \ncan ensure that investors can’t capture short-term \ngains while escaping long-term costs by redirecting \ncapital from intensive, industrial practices (such as \nanimal farming) to more sustainable ones (such as \nalternative protein production).\n• Financial institutions can shift capital  toward \nregenerative agriculture, alternative protein and \nfood waste upcycling companies, while actively \nencouraging investee companies to adopt such \nmethods. They can also set clear processes  for \nportfolio assessment, monitoring and reporting \nto maintain transparency and accountability, and \nimplement robust monitoring systems to detect \nharmful practices such as deforestation and high \nmethane emissions. They can also divest  from \ncompanies with evidence of negative environmental \nor social impacts, while ensuring rigorous due \ndiligence  to differentiate genuine sustainable \npractices from greenwashing. 86\nRestructure economic incentives and regulations to \nprioritise regenerative farming models and holistic \nland management practices\nRegenerative farming remains a difficult model to bring \nto the mainstream due to, partly, a lack of alignment \naround the definitions and distorted economic \nsignals expressed by prices that don’t reflect the \ntrue environmental and social costs of mainstream \nagricultural practices. Designing agricultural policies in \nsupport of regenerative approaches and progressively \nshifting funds, pricing models and subsidies could \nstructurally change the playing field and drive \ntransformation. 87, 88 \n• Ensure a true price for sustainable food that \nfully reflects the social and environmental impacts \nso that products of regenerative and sustainable \nfarming are competitive and attractive. Aligning \nprice signals and shifting fiscal incentives away \nfrom heavily polluting practices could encourage \nfarmers to place longer-term investments in \nsustainable practices that are demonstrated to \nenhance soil health, reduce synthetic fertiliser \nand pesticide use, cut water use and enhance \nbiodiversity, for example. Direct subsidies \naway from industrial agriculture  and towards \nsupporting farmers’ incomes and sustainable \nsolutions, such as solar-powered irrigation, organic \nnutrients for soil and integrated pest-management \nsolutions.\n• Establish fact-based regulatory frameworks \ntailored to particular farming systems and regions \nto support the roll out of carefully implemented \nagroecological approaches and regenerative \npractices, such as increasing biomass cycling \nand the nutrient balance while promoting the \nbiodiversity of systems. 89 Governments can enable \nthese practices and ensure efficient approval \nprocesses, certifications, labels and accessible \nintellectual property  to secure farmers’ access and \ncontrol over natural and other productive resources. \nThis will also help them scale up technologies and \nreduce costs, making sustainable products such as \nalternative protein production more accessible.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT\n51\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n50\n\n\nEmpower and protect farmers engaged in \nregenerative agricultural practices\nMany communities rely heavily on agriculture for \ntheir economic well-being and require assistance \nand protection as they transition. Farmers who feel \nsecure in their transition process are more likely \nto embrace innovative and sustainable farming \nmethods. In addition to access to finance, it is \nimportant to ensure farmers have access to avenues \nto reskill and upskill and transition towards more \nsustainable farming practices. \n• Create just transition funds to de-risk and \nenable changes in farming practices, supplying \nfarmers with the tools and knowledge they need \nto convert their farms. This could specifically \ninclude transition payments to reduce risk \naversion, and access to lower interest rates \nand insurance products that protect farmers \nfrom extreme weather events, crop failure, or \nother unexpected damages. This will provide \nfarmers with the safety net needed to transition \nto more regenerative practices or compensate \nthem appropriately if they decide to retire or \nchange career path. Capacity-building, training \nand reskilling programmes will also be crucial \nto upskill and leverage existing regenerative \npractices.\nCOCOAACTION BRASIL USES \nREGENERATIVE FARMING TO \nEMPOWER SMALL-SCALE COCOA \nFARMERS AND POSITIVELY IMPACT \nCOCOA PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.\nWhile multinational corporations control \nmuch of the sale and profits of the world’s \nchocolate, the majority of the world’s cocoa \nbeans are grown on small farms in the Global \nSouth. When it comes to producing cocoa \nsustainably and ethically, farmers often \nlack the technical knowledge and resources \nto implement such practices. 90 This is the \ncase in Brazil—the sixth largest producer \nof cocoa on the planet—where upwards of \n95,000 growers produce cocoa. 91 To promote \nsustainability with a focus on the grower, \nCocoaAction Brasil, a comprehensive \npublic-private pre-competitive initiative,  \nlaunched in 2018.\nCocoaAction Brasil works with value chain \npartners to align and develop the cocoa \nchain and promote knowledge exchange \nand synergies with existing work, giving \nspecial attention to sustainability. The \ninitiative enables value chain partners to \ndo so in four key ways: 1) working with \nproducers  to increase yield and quality and \nimprove farm management; 2) working \nwith communities  to strengthen working \nconditions, youth and gendered work, \nand labour unions; 3) working with the \ngovernment  on reforestation, agroforestry \nand land conservation; and 4) working \nacross the value chain  to increase access \nto funding and land regulation, information \nmanagement and governance. \nIn working with policymakers, CocoaAction \nBrasil has supported the publication of the \nNormative Instructions of Pará and Rondônia  \n(two northern Brazilian states), which enable \nthe recovery of legal reserves through cocoa \ncultivation in agroforestry systems. It has \nfurther revised Ordinances in the Bahia \nand Espírito Santo states that regulate the \nmanagement of the cabruca cocoa cultivation \nsystem and reinforce its relevance to the \npreservation of the Atlantic Forest. It also \ncontributed to improving the Plano Safra \n(Crop Plan) 2021–2022 , based on submissions \nfrom stakeholders and advocacy with the \nMinistry of Economy. These measures \ngenerate socio-environmental benefits, \ngenerate income for families and \nstimulate biodiversity conservation.\nCocoaAction Brasil also worked to increase \nsmall growers’ access to credit between \n2017 and 2021 by 240% through multiple \ninitiatives. For one, it coordinated GT \nCrédito, a working group that specifically \naddresses credit in the cocoa chain, linked \nwith the Cocoa and Agroforestry Systems \nSectoral Chamber of the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. It \nobtained the inclusion of rural residents \nin the Pronaf Floresta  credit line and cocoa \ngrown in agroforestry systems in the Pronaf \nBioeconomia  credit line. Finally, in partnership \nwith the International Labour Organisation, \nCocoaAction Brasil involved more than 50 \nentities of the public and private sectors \nand civil society to produce the Cacau 2030 \nStrategic Guidelines , a set of guiding actions \nfor the sustainable development of cocoa \nproduction focused on decent labour and \nbetter living conditions.\nOne company that has directly benefited \nfrom CocoaAction Brasil’s initiatives is \nDengo Chocolates—a sustainable and \nethical chocolate company based in the \nBrazilian state of Bahia. Dengo encourages \norganic cocoa, regenerative agriculture and \nagroforestry with 100% of the brand's cocoa \ncoming from traditional agroforestry \nsystems  known as cabruca . For its chocolate \nproduction, the company only purchases \ncocoa from local producers,  and farmers \nreceive more for the product they deliver—\nwith Dengo paying a premium of up to 160% \nof the market value for high-quality cocoa \nbeans.92\nDengo has found success and made a \nmajor impact on local communities by \nconnecting small- and medium-scale \nfarmers who are interested in creating \na high-quality product,  thus establishing \na network of local farmers for the mass \nproduction of chocolate. The network \nfollows the cultivation process set out by \nDengo to achieve the best possible cocoa. \nThe company provides free technical \nconsultancy and access to knowledge  \nabout harvesting, fermenting and drying \ncocoa beans. Today, the network consists of \naround 200 families of farmers and a part \nof the company’s profits are shared with \nthese farmers.\nTo date, Dengo boasts 100% student \nattendance, while 38% of its in-network \nfarmers earn above the minimum living wage \nand 45% have access to credit. To further \nembed sustainability into its products, \n34% of Dengo's products are sold in bulk, \npackaging is just 7% plastic and entirely \nrecyclable. Some packaging is even made \nfrom cocoa-based paper using production \nby-products. By designing its products \nsustainably and tapping into traditional \ncabruca agroforestry methods, the company \nhas preserved 20 hectares of Brazilian \nforest. 93 \nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\nToday, more than ever, \nsocial dialogue should be \nintegral to our policy efforts \nto a just transition towards \nenvironmental sustainability \nand the circular economy.\nElisenda Estruch Puertas, \nInternational Labour Organization\n53\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n52\n\n\nSYST EM TWO: ADVANCE \nCIRCULAR MANUFACTURING\nWhat could a circular manufacturing system look \nlike in Grow  countries? \nCircular manufacturing systems in Grow  countries have \nthe potential to intertwine economic, environmental \nand social elements in a way that fundamentally \nreshapes the fabric of society. Central to this vision is \nthe design phase of products, which prioritises their \nentire lifecycle and focuses on qualities like durability \nand modularity. This shift can open the door for \nmany skilled job opportunities, from design engineers \nspecialising in sustainable materials to technicians \ntrained in product repair and remanufacture, heralding \na resurgence of craftsmanship and localised industries. \nMeanwhile, domestic and international trade \nevolves to prioritise exchanging sustainable and \ncircular products, components and services. This \nreimagined trade ecosystem values transparency, \nensuring products crossing borders meet stringent \nsustainability and ethical labour standards. Ultimately, \njustice and equity lie at the heart of this transition. \nRecognising that the shift to circularity might present \nchallenges—especially for those in extractive \nindustries and waste management—policies and \nsupport systems have been put in place. \nIn this adjusted system, industrial clusters, hubs \nand parks are strategically localised to capitalise \non synergies between sectors. Raw materials are \nchosen for their quality and social and environmental \nfootprints, emphasising sustainable and recycled \ninputs. This focus can spur a renaissance in local \nindustries that recover, process and recycle materials, \nstrengthening regional supply chains and promoting \nfair trade practices. Instead of becoming victims of \nobsolescence, local manufacturers become invaluable \nnodes in a resilient, interdependent network. Along \nwith production, consumption in this new paradigm \nis about conscious choices. People embrace making \ntheir products last, leading to a greater demand for \nmaintenance and repair services. This will lengthen \nproduct lifetimes and increase demand for Vocational \nEducation and Training (VET), equipping individuals \nwith the skills needed for a circular economy. Through \nthese comprehensive measures, Grow  countries can \ncraft fair, prosperous, and sustainable futures.\nHow can we unlock this vision in Grow  countries? \nOur circular vision for manufacturing in Grow  countries \nwill require a comprehensive policy mix to decarbonise \nand make industrial processes more circular. 94 Policies \nshould manage both supply and demand, embracing \n'push' and 'pull' measures, complemented by emphasis \non knowledge flows and technology transfers. The keys \nto unlocking this vision include, but are not limited to:\nRemove barriers to scaling circular manufacturing \nwith clear and mandatory targets and aligned \nincentives\nMandatory environmental impact reduction targets \nand policy incentives that promote innovative circular \nproduction processes can ensure that systems are \noptimised to reduce total material demand and save \nenergy. Creating clear targets and aligning incentives \nfor producers can overcome one of the core barriers to \nsustainable manufacturing, which is the ease and cost-\neffectiveness for companies to pollute and not incur \ncost or liability.\n• Introduce policy measures —including technology \nor performance requirements —that impose \nand enforce public bans and limits on pollution. \nOr, develop legislation that mandates ambitious \nExtended Producer Responsibility schemes 95 \nor requires a minimum amount of recovered \nmaterials for all new production  to cut resource \ndepletion, waste generation and air pollution, while \nminimising rebound effects.\n• Create economic incentives via pull mechanisms,  \nby properly taxing material- and carbon-intensive \nproduction and trade, and rolling out subsidies \nto encourage energy-efficient production and \nappropriate pricing of common resources. 96 This will \nserve to promote material cycling, extend product \nlifetimes and improve material and value retention, \nsubstitution and efficiency.\n• Integrate clusters and eco-industrial parks, and \nhubs into national policy frameworks such as \ndevelopment plans and national industrial strategies \nto foster industrial symbiosis and decarbonisation, \nespecially in resource-intensive sectors like metals, \ncement, chemicals and paper. 97 \nEnsure policy alignment to support industrial \ntransitions\n This means, for example, ensuring environmental \nimpact reduction targets (alongside others) are \nsupported by labour and education policies that can \ncreate demand for the occupations and skills needed \nto deliver on these goals.\n• Take an ambitious, mission-oriented approach to \nindustrial policy  that directs investments towards \nmaximising public-value creation and people’s \nwellbeing within ecological limits. 98 To this end, \ngovernments can directly invest in developing \nand adopting advanced technology  via subsidies \nand direct investment support schemes, such as \ninvestment funds  and public or private grants , \nto boost research and development into alternative \nmaterials to reduce upfront costs and risks. \n• Scale eco-industrial parks  via public-private \npartnerships with centralised management to \neffectively plan and coordinate services, including \nthe maintenance of a data system that can optimise \nresource-use and pollution control systems. Invest \nin common infrastructure,  such as district steam, \nwater management, heat neatworks, and energy, \ntransport and digital facilities to enable high-\nvalue industrial symbiosis that minimises waste \ngeneration and pollution. Promote collaboration \nbetween local academia and research \ninstitutions and companies  to deliver the \nnecessary technologies and innovation to meet the \ndesired outcomes of an inclusive circular economy \ntransition in the manufacturing sector. \nDirect significant capital investments and promote \ntechnology transfers to increase access to and \nhelp scale up innovative green and clean tech that \ndelivers cost savings, drives down material demand \nand reduces pollution\nA range of barriers severely constrain the ability of \nGrow countries to access and disseminate affordable \ntechnologies that are essential for environmental \nand climate objectives, such as: high costs related to \nlicensing fees and technology prices, limited access \ndue to overly protective patent restrictions and \nmonopolistic business dynamics, and innovation \nbarriers preventing knowledge sharing.\n• Develop policies to overcome barriers to access \nand facilitate the transfer of cleaner technology. For \ninstance, waivers to Intellectual Property Rights \ncan be introduced to improve access to technology \nthat helps facilitate deep electrification and \nleapfrogging to circular industrial activities, such \nas green hydrogen. This is particularly relevant for \nhard-to-abate industries such as steel and cement \nproduction. Shift countries can, via multilateral \nagreements, legislate, regulate, incentivise and \ncompel multilateral corporations  to enter into \nagreements with companies or governments to \nrevise intellectual property laws to introduce more \nflexibility and thus enable the rapid deployment of \ntechnologies that Grow  countries need, but currently \ncan’t access.\n• Ensure investments integrate social \nrequirements made on the basis of sound \nsocioeconomic indicators, to ensure socioeconomic \nbenefits are promoted and externalities are \nmitigated or prevented where possible. This \nshould include a strong focus on decent work and \noccupational health and safety, where existing \ncircular economy activities in these countries involve \nprecious and unsafe work. Where investments and \nsupport policies work to leverage or scale these \nexisting practices, it heightens the need to address \nworking conditions and the social protection system \nneeded to support working particularly in growing \nand emerging industries.\nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\nDevelop a forward-looking plan on sustainable \nskills development for the jobs of tomorrow\nGrow countries must navigate a rapidly changing \nlandscape of technological development throughout \nthe manufacturing sector. A significant factor for \nsuccess will be to properly educate and train people \nto master the skills for the economy of tomorrow. \nThis must be done in a holistic way to ensure that \nvulnerable groups are included in this transition  \nand society as a whole can benefit from decent  \nwork opportunities.\n• Invest in skills development programmes \nwith particular focus on workers vulnerable \nto the transition. Reskilling and upskilling can \nhelp workers be reallocated to jobs within the \nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT\n55\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n54\n\n\nsame occupations in growing industries, while \nprofessional training can support workers in \ndeclining industries move into new sectors. \nRetraining and empowering workers to understand \nprinciples of sustainable industry, such as Industry \n4.0, automation and additive manufacturing will be \nkey to supporting workers in Grow  countries. This \nmust be underpinned by effective social dialogue \nbetween governments, employers’ and workers’ \norganisations, which can ensure that the provision \nof skills development meets demand and those \nmost at risk.\n• Set up systems for identifying and anticipating \nskills needs and mapping skills needs across the \nentire value chain.  Conduct a detailed empirical \nanalysis of emerging green skill demands on country \nand regional levels with an analysis of the available \nskill supply to identify skills gaps within and across \npartner countries. Formulate strategies for closing \nthese gaps through skills development policies and \nother interventions.\n• Encourage exchanges between VET institutions \nand industry so that VET educators can update \ntheir knowledge and ensure their offerings meet \nnew industry demands. Support trainers in firms \nto update and formalise their teaching skills \nacross disciplines. This can further strengthen \nbridges between education and the world of work, \nand leverage the knowledge and skills held by \nentrepreneurs working both in the formal and \ninformal sectors.\n• Promote social dialogue and partnership in \nplanning, designing and implementing national \nand sectoral policies  for the just transition. The \ninclusion of all relevant stakeholders—including \nworkers—will be key to ensure that decent work \nand social conditions are embedded within just \ntransition policies and within curricula to upskill \nworkers and their employers on safe ways of \nworking in the circular economy.\nEven with a will to reuse, many \ncompanies find themselves \nhandcuffed by the absence of the \nright infrastructure, knowledge or \ntechnological prowess.\nPaula Peláez, IDB Invest\nCHINA’S MANUFACTURING \nSECTOR IS BEING UPGRADED \nTHROUGH AN ECO-INDUSTRIAL \nPARK PROGRAMME, \nINDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS AND \nREMANUFACTURING.\nChina’s high-speed economic \ndevelopment has secured its status \nas a global industrial powerhouse. \nWhile there are many socioeconomic \nbenefits to rapid growth, the increased \nconcentration of industrial activity \nhas come at a very high cost to the \nenvironment: pollution, waste generation \nand ecosystem degradation, to name a \nfew.99 China’s industrial parks account for \nover two-thirds of the nation’s energy \nconsumption and GHG emissions.  To \nalleviate the negative environmental \nimpacts of its manufacturing sector, \nChina has adopted the concept of an \n‘ecological civilisation’—a system of \ndevelopment and governance based \non the principles of environmental \nmanagement, ecological restoration and \ngreen development. 100\nChina's ‘ ecological civilisation ’ \nconsists of a set of initiatives based on \nenhanced sustainable production and \nconsumption, superior environmental \nand ecological planning for both urban \nand rural regions, and an industrial \necology that champions a comprehensive \ncircular economy with a zero-waste \napproach.101 Within this context, China \ninitiated its eco-industrial parks (EIPs) \nprogramme in 2001. EIPs are strategically \ndesigned as a blueprint for industrial \nclustering and transformation based \non clean production mandates, and \ncircular economy and industrial ecology \nprinciples. By 2021, the number of \nestablished EIPs had reached 55, up from \njust one in 2008, while another 52 are \nnow underway. 102\nChina has been successful in \ntransforming its industrial sector due \nin large part to three major factors: \ngovernmental frameworks and \ntechnical guidance, manufacturing \nprowess and strategic blueprints, \nand local governance and academic \nsynergy.  In terms of governmental \nframeworks and technical guidance, \nsustainability was heralded as a priority \nat the national level, resulting in an array \nof policies, incentives and regulations \nthat bolstered industrial clustering \nand transformation via eco-industrial \nparks and activities such as industrial \nsymbiosis and remanufacturing. 103 \nThe environmental governance \nsystem was modernised to ensure \nthat standardisations, monitoring \nand innovation incentives rendered \noperational harmony across industries.\nThe manufacturing prowess and strategic \nblueprints of China’s EIPs further lent \nthemselves to the creation of a more \ncircular industrial sector. The sheer \nscale of its manufacturing provided a \nunique platform where industries could \nnaturally form symbiotic relationships. \nThe parks' designs were inherently \nstrategic, ensuring industrial clustering \nand transformation so that neighbouring \nindustries could share resources, \nthereby reducing costs and logistics-\nrelated constraints, for example. Finally, \nlocal governments played a crucial \nrole, adapting national guidelines to fit \nlocal contexts and providing requisite \nincentives. Meanwhile, local academic \ninstitutions and industries joined forces, \nhoning technological and process \ninnovations and fostering a relationship \nof ongoing research and development. 104, \n105\nLooking at China's journey, it is important \nto note that while the nation blazed \nsubstantial trails in championing \nindustrial sustainability, the path will \nnever be obstacle-free. For example, \nconcerns remain around total resource \nuse and lacking social impact research. 106 \nThe number of EIPs in China is also \nlimited compared to traditional industrial \nparks and zones and their type and size \nvaries considerably. Nevertheless, EIPs \nreduce virgin resource use, emissions \nand waste generation compared to \ntraditional industrial parks and zones. 107, \n108 EIPs have also been proven to drive \ninnovation, attract human and financial \ncapital, produce technology spillovers \nand positively impact surrounding \nareas.109 Other Grow  countries can extract \nvaluable lessons from China's successful \nstrategies and apply best practices \nwithin their own economies to chart their \nsustainable industrial trajectories.\n57\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n56\n\n\nBUILD\nCOUNTRIES\nCIRCULARITY IN\nINCREASE MATERIAL \nCONSUMPTION TO \nSECURE WELLBEING\n6\nSETTING THE SCENE\nBuild nations boast rapidly expanding economies, \nvast populations and abundant natural resources—\nand consequently hold substantial potential to \ndrive the transition towards a circular economy. \nHowever, Build countries also grapple with a \nset of multifaceted constraints emanating from \ninternational trade dynamics and the overarching \ninternational financial architecture. 110 As a result, \nthese economies are often relegated to exporting \nraw materials or low-value-added products to Shift \ncountries, not only restricting their ability to climb \nthe economic value chain but also having profound \nnegative environmental and social impacts. 111\nThus, many low-income countries must balance the \nurgent need to improve living standards and reduce \npoverty while addressing pressing environmental \nissues. These nations need more resources and face \ncompeting demands for investment in critical sectors \nlike healthcare, education and infrastructure. With \nlarge—and growing—populations, Build  countries \nalso face high levels of youth unemployment and \nunderemployment. Many workers are employed in \nthe informal economy: on one hand, this is often \ncharacterised by necessity-driven value-retaining \npractices for materials and goods, but it is also \nassociated with precarious employment, and limited \nor absent social protection and collective bargaining \nschemes. Women tend to be over-represented in \ninformal and vulnerable employment as they continue \nto face various barriers to accessing formal jobs. \nGender wage gaps persist within Build  countries’ \nlabour markets, and specific segments of marginalised \ngroups within society tend to face inequities such as \ndiscrimination and limited access to social protection.\nLooking ahead, Build  countries should leverage \ncircular practices that have long been present in \ntheir communities, as well as knowledge rooted \nin Indigenous groups. But they will also need to \ninvest in new technologies and practices that allow \nfor sustainable human development, particularly \nin material-intensive industries like food, energy \nand construction. This will require access to \ntechnology and know-how, significant financial \nresources and human capital to ensure proper \nimplementation and scaling. This poses an acute \nrisk to Build  nations: a debt burden far beyond their \nability to shoulder alone. With this in mind, the \nParis Agreement emphasises the need for global \ncooperation, with wealthier countries providing \nsupport to lower-income Build  countries in the \nform of financial resources, technology transfer \nand capacity-building. This is essential to aid their \nefforts in mitigating and (crucially) adapting to \nclimate change. \n59\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n58\n\n\nSYST EM ONE: NURTURE A \nCIRCULAR FOOD SYSTEM\nWhat could a circular food system look like in Build  \ncountries?\nAgricultural workers in Build  countries face challenges \nlike never before, from climate-change-induced \ndroughts and floods to financial crises, conflicts \nand pandemics. They also tend to be in the bottom \n40% based on income, putting them in a vulnerable \nposition. A circular food system—built on the \ncornerstones of wellbeing and resilience—can usher in \na new normal. \nIn a circular food system, regenerative  practices are \nthe norm: techniques like cover cropping, agroforestry \nand holistic grazing are applied at scale to nourish soil, \nsequester carbon and enhance biodiversity. Farmers \nhave access to both cutting-edge technologies and \nhigh-quality inputs as well as the knowledge and \nsupport necessary to use them, allowing them to \nfarm their land to the benefit of people and planet. \nSubstantial investment in education—especially in \nrural areas—results in a well-trained agricultural \nworkforce with abundant regenerative and circular \nknowledge. Thanks to circular  practices, such as a \ndiverse rotation of local crops and livestock, as well \nas techniques that boost production with minimal \nartificial fertilisers, food is organic, seasonal and \nhighly nutritious. All packaging is reusable and \ncompostable, helping cut waste throughout the value \nchain. Unavoidable biomass waste—surplus food and \ncrop residues, for example—is minimised by valorising \nand cascading to its maximum value. This includes \ncomposting so crucial nutrients return to the soil, \ndeveloping high-value products or converting it into \nbioenergy to sustainably power local communities. \nA circular food system feeds into wellbeing, too: local \nmarkets, cooperatives and farm-to-table initiatives \nconnect farmers with the people they feed, ensuring \ntheir access to fresh, sustainably-grown food while \nsecuring fair wages for farmers and access to land, \nand bringing more equitable opportunities for women. \nEducation and cultural events are used to cultivate \na deeper appreciation for farmers and the land they \nwork, and promote food literacy and traditional \nculinary practices. A circular food system ensures \nmore than sustainability—it nurtures nutrition and a \ndeeply-rooted sense of community, preserving cultural \nheritage and encouraging stewardship for the Earth.\nHow can we unlock this vision in Build  countries? \nWe envision a future where food is not just a \ncommodity but a vital source of life and community. \nUnlocking this vision, however, will require action \nthroughout the value chain; this includes the fair \npricing of regenerative practices and products, \nstrategic investments, supportive policies and \ncommunity-led initiatives. The keys to unlocking this \nvision include, but are not limited to:\nEnact policies that help unlock investment in \nmuch-needed climate mitigation and adaptation\nBuild countries need help to make essential \ninvestments in sustainability due to their excessive \ndebt burden. High-income, Western creditor countries \nhave the financial capacity, technological expertise, \nand global influence in global institutions to help \nlower-income countries unlock funds. This will be \nessential to advance smart material management \nand environmental stewardship aligned with climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation measures, including \necosystem preservation and regeneration.\n• Implement debt relief and fair access to \ncapital markets to national governments in \nBuild countries,  such as reliable nature-for-\ndebt swaps 112 and via Green Bonds and Climate \nFunds.113 Through the reduction of sovereign \ndebt burdens and fair and preferential access to \nfinancial markets, national governments have an \nincreased capacity to mobilise capital towards \nregenerative farming, nature-based solutions and \ninfrastructure. 114\n• Implement efficient, stable and transparent \nregulatory and business frameworks  that \nimprove how many resources and investment flow \ninto the agricultural sector to explicitly improve \nenvironmental and social outcomes. Coupled with \ndebt relief and cheap access to affordable capital—\nvia low interest rates, for example—a regulatory \nframework that sets a clear vision for environmental \nand social outcomes is key to minimise investment \nrisks and encourage efficient capital allocation. \n• Secure land rights and tenure policies to protect \nsmallholder farmers from land grabs, provide \nlegal recognition for customary land rights and/or \noffer long-term leases. This is critical for farmers’ \nconfidence in investing in and transitioning \ntowards long-term regenerative practices. \n• Set concrete policy targets for soil, water and \nbiodiversity  to establish long-term strategic goals \nand send clear signals to market players about \nwhere to invest in the future. Clear targets would \nunlock significant and sustained investments \nfrom large-scale farmers and multinational \ncorporations, encouraging the wide-scale adoption \nof regenerative practices. These targets should be \ncombined with financial incentives and monitoring \nframeworks that can provide feedback on how to \nsteer targets over time.\nStrengthen resilience in small- and medium-scale \nagriculture with improved market access\nThis would address barriers such as a lack of access \nto market information, limited market access, price \nvolatility and inadequate infrastructure. Ultimately, \nit could enable farmers to make more informed \ndecisions, reach a wider market and receive fair \ncompensation for their produce. This is crucial to \nenhance food security, boost farmers' income, and \nfoster sustainable agricultural practices.\n• Promote farming cooperatives by supporting \nand financing aggregator models where a central \nentity, such as a cooperative or social enterprise, \nconsolidates smallholder farmers' produce and \nprovides services such as access to finance and \ntechnical assistance. Additionally, fund ‘backbone \norganisations’ 115 that can deliver capacity-\nbuilding programmes, and test and scale digital \nsolutions. These organisations can also invest in \ntransportation and storage infrastructure to help \nsmallholder farmers overcome financial barriers \nand achieve economies of scale.\n• Update standards to help the creation of new \nmarkets that allow for circular practices such as \nthe use of byproducts or treatment of organic \nwaste, for example. Ensure that this is done \nefficiently and safely and support businesses and \nindividuals in adopting these practices.\nEnable farmers to invest in innovations to increase \nagricultural output and quality 116 \nOne of the key barriers in Build countries is farmers' \nlack of access to resources and formal education. \nBy increasing access to funding, skills development, \nknowledge and technology, farmers can steadily \nscale up regenerative and sustainable models of food \nproduction. \n• Credit farmers and landowners  engaging in \nregenerative agriculture for the restoration and \nstewardship of ecosystems. For example, reliable, \nhigh-quality carbon and biodiversity credits  \ncan be used to incentivise practices that sequester \ncarbon and improve soil health and biodiversity. \nThis would give farmers who are transitioning to—or \nmaintaining—regenerative agriculture additional \nincome, making regenerative practices more \nattractive and viable over the long-term.\n• Make the transition less risky for small-scale \nfarmers who fundamentally lack resources \nby increasing their access to financial and \ninsurance services such as grants, microfinance \nand smallholder loan guarantees. This makes \ninvestments in inputs like seeds and new equipment \nor practices that improve soil health more appealing \nand convenient.\nEnsure ‘future-proof’ skill-sets with training \nand skills pathways and recognise Indigenous, \nregenerative practices\nGaining the necessary knowledge and skills is a key \nbarrier due to the vast number of people working in \nagriculture in Build  countries. A proactive approach will \nbe necessary to endow current and future generations \nof workers in this sector with the knowledge and \npractical skills needed to achieve an ambitious \ntransformation of the food system. \n• Facilitate the transition from the informal to the \nformal economy for both workers and economic \nunits. Agriculture in Build  countries is characterised \nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT\nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n61\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n60\n\n\nby high levels of informality which, in turn, is often \nrelated to low productivity and poor working \nconditions. Informality often acts as a barrier to \naccessing skills development programmes and \nother government support. To tackle this, create \nan enabling environment for the formalisation of \nenterprise and expand the application of labour \nlaw and social protection to employers and workers \nengaged in circular activities.\n• Promote knowledge transfer, training and \ncomprehensive skills development programmes  \nto valorise workers’ skills, and especially to help \nbring women into the labour market. Equipping \nsmallholder farmers with the tools and knowledge \nto engage in methods such as regenerative \nagriculture, intercropping, mixed cropping, and \nmore can support the shift towards a more climate-\nsmart model of production. Workers should also be \nsupported in developing technical and transversal \nskills, and cultivating new practices within their \ncommunities. 117 \n• Support a holistic curriculum for skills \ndevelopment and training through  a participatory \nmethod that involves all relevant stakeholders. This \ncan ensure that existing local culture, production \nmethods and knowledge are preserved while also \npromoting continuous and lifelong learning to \nenable workers to keep up with new innovations and \ntechnologies.\n• Establish employment-related services  \nthat are adapted to the needs of the rural \npopulations. These, such as labour orientation \nand intermediation services, can provide locally-\nrelevant information that can help facilitate rural \npeople and particularly rural youth's access to \njob opportunities, as well as agricultural support \nservices and entrepreneurship opportunities.\n• Recognise informally learnt and practised \nregenerative approaches  in formal education, \nnamely Vocational Education and Training (VET). \nStrive to leverage Indigenous ways of knowing and \nrecognise them in curriculum and qualifications. \n• Establish funding for skills development \ninitiatives  that call for the coordination of both \nprivate and public financing to promote innovation \nand training. Under skills development programmes, \nspecific vulnerable groups should be targeted, such \nas workers in rural communities, women, migrants \nand informal workers. \nNATIONAL STANDARDS CAN \nSUPPORT THE PRODUCTION \nOF INSECT-BASED PROTEIN TO \nCUT COSTS, EMISSIONS, WASTE \nAND MORE.\nThe Black Soldier Fly (BSF) offers a \npromising avenue to valorise food \nwaste, cut emissions and lift Build  \nresidents out of poverty. Food waste \nposes a problem around the world: \nin Sub-Saharan Africa, around 125 \nmillion tonnes of organic waste is \ngenerated each year—most of which \ndegrades in open landfills, harming \nhuman health and releasing emissions. \nWhat’s more, as incomes begin to rise \nin Build countries, so do appetites for \nmeat—but current practices associated \nwith animal agriculture, such as land-\nuse change to make space to grow \nfeed crops, pose many threats to the \nenvironment. \nInsect-based protein may offer an all-\nin-one solution. To combat the issues \nof food waste, land use change and the \nswelling cost of animal feed, the Kenya \nBureau of Standards has approved \nthree National Standards to support \nthe production of edible insects, as \nwell as their processed by-products. \nThese guidelines will instruct insect \nfarmers on how to ensure the safety of \ntheir product and meet environmental \nregulations, while gaining accreditations \nfor their businesses and certificates for \ntheir products. This will allow insect-\nbased products to be widely sold in \nKenya and beyond. 118\nWhile these National Standards \nare relatively new, research shows \nthe promising potential for impact: \nfarmed insects, such as the BSF, make \nexcellent livestock feed—with BSF-\nfed pigs reaching market weight a \nmonth earlier than their traditionally-\nfed counterparts. This can cut feed \ncosts by as much as 15% , both \nbenefiting farmers and reducing the \nland needed to grow crops for livestock \nconsumption. One study found that—at \nits current rate of production—African \ninsect farming could generate 14% \nof the crude protein needed to feed \nall the pigs, goats, fish and chickens \nacross the continent. By converting the \norganic waste generated each year in \nSub-Saharan Africa, insect farming has \nthe potential to save 86 million tonnes \nof CO2e—equivalent to removing 18 \nmillion vehicles from the road. Efficient \nconverters, insects can transform \nfood waste into a more useful form: \nwith the potential to recycle as much \nas 18 million tonnes of waste into \nfertiliser,  the BSF is a crucial pathway \nto greener, less polluted cities. Insect-\nbased fertilisers have proved incredibly \neffective, too: maize plots treated with \nBSF fertiliser resulted in yields 14% \nhigher than those treated with existing \ncommercial organic fertilisers. \nIf scaled, impacts could be even \nlarger: one 2020 study, for example, \nfound that replacing half of the fish \nmeal traditionally used in animal feed \nwith insect meal could make enough \nfish and maize available to feed an \nadditional 4.8 million people  each \nyear in Kenya alone—while providing \n33,000 additional jobs per year,  \nreducing poverty for an estimated 3.2 \nmillion people. 119 These results could be \nreplicable across Africa, and may even \nserve to kickstart women- or youth-led \nagricultural ventures—as both groups \nare often deterred from starting their \nown businesses due to lacking the \nnecessary capital.\n63\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n62\n\n\nSYST EM TWO: BUILD \nA CIRCULAR BUILT \nENVIRONMENT\nWhat could a circular built environment look like in \nBuild countries?\nBuild countries face a serious challenge: building up \nhomes, workplaces and infrastructure for their growing \npopulations in a way that benefits people with minimal \nharm to the environment. In a circular built environment, \nwellbeing is addressed at every corner: urban planning \nmakes residents’ lives easier through compact, walkable \nneighbourhoods with reliable and well-connected public \ntransport. Owning or driving a car is far less desirable—\nwhy go to that effort when public transport is quick, \ncheap, safe and easy? In these neighbourhoods, air and \nnoise pollution are drastically lower, improving residents’ \nhealth, and public spaces are designed to foster \nconnection and belonging. \nBuildings are circular, too: local, sustainable materials—\nthink wood instead of concrete, for example—are used \nas efficiently as possible to cut waste at every stage, \nfrom design and construction to use and eventually \ndeconstruction. Structures are built to last, with a careful \nbalance struck between durability and material choice at \nthe design stage. Every building feature is designed for \npositive impact: walls and roofs are used to grow plants, \nfor example, boosting biodiversity and providing natural \ncooling. Passive House principles are applied to all new \nbuilds to cut energy demand as much as possible and \nmake the most of sunlight and fresh air—while excellent \ninsulation protects from heat, cold and moisture. At \nthe end of their lifetimes, buildings are deconstructed \nrather than demolished, so that every material and \ncomponent—from doors and windows to wooden \nbeams—can be used again. \nWorkers in the built environment value chain have \nseized existing and new roles and opportunities. They \nare fairly paid and protected from harm at work. They’re \nequipped with the skills needed to make this a success, \nfrom knowledge of material handling and design for \nsustainability to technical installation and testing and \nmachine operation. Financial resources are geared \ntowards the necessary capital investments needed to \nbuild a circular built environment. \nHow can we unlock this vision in Build  countries? \nOur circular vision for Build  countries’ built \nenvironment sees cities and towns that are \nsustainable, resilient and livable for all social strata, \noffering a high quality of life while minimising \nenvironmental impact. The keys to unlocking this \nvision include, but are not limited to:\nCultivate a conducive policy environment for a \ncircular built environment value chain\nBuild countries face challenges in enforcing \nbuilding codes and standards due to lack of follow-\nup mechanisms and because of the prevalence \nof informal construction and demand for cheap \nhousing. This can lead to subpar construction quality \nand inefficient material use as well as potential safety \nhazards.120 A lack of policy incentives to promote \ncircular economy practices coupled with inadequate \nwaste management and recycling infrastructure, \nas well as limited technology and innovation to \nrepurpose and reuse materials hinder the creation of \na circular built environment value chain. 121 \n• Develop and implement localised, tailored and \nsimplified building codes and set enhanced \nstandards  that prioritise and incentivise low-tech \nclimate-smart buildings, circular maintenance and \nrenovation, and the use of local, renewable and \nsecondary materials. \n• Leverage circular public procurement  to \nsupport traditional, circular building techniques \nand materials as well as demand for circular skills \nin construction by setting strict requirements \non the profiles and technical expertise needed. \nThis can stimulate local circular businesses by \nencouraging workforce development and local \nmanufacturing, and can create simpler and more \nlocal supply chains.\n• Identify dominant regional waste streams  \nand offer guidelines on safely and effectively \nintegrating waste into construction by converting \nit into building materials.\n• Ensure regulations prioritise circular practices \nsuch as repair, renovation, retrofitting and \nmaintenance, particularly given the high share \nof low-cost, low-quality and energy-inefficient \nbuildings.\nAllow local governments to plan and adapt for \ncircularity with financial and technical resources\nMany cities in Build  countries are grappling with \nthe complexities of rapid and uncontrolled urban \ngrowth, often in informal settlements. To address \nthese challenges, collaborative efforts that include \ngovernmental bodies, international organisations \nand local communities are essential to develop and \nimplement strategies that ensure urban development \nis both resource-efficient, sustainable and inclusive.\n• Use development funds to directly support urban \nplanning departments  with financial, technical and \nhuman resources to rapidly implement carefully-\nconsidered urban planning initiatives. These can \ninclude financing for capacity-building programmes \nand circular urban development plans for the \ndevelopment of resource-efficient and climate-\nsmart public spaces, infrastructure and services, \nthat can also make commercial developments more \npeople-centric and resilient. \n• Provide affordable access to capital and \ntechnologies —such as prefabrication and 3D \nprinting—to help scale practical solutions such as \nplastic sand bricks. Equip facilities to transform \nwaste into usable construction materials. \nFurthermore, roll out development funds to \nsubsidise the innovation required to utilise local \nmaterials at scale for commercial buildings, as \ncurrently, international materials are trusted more \nand are less expensive.\nFacilitate labour-intensive circular building \nsolutions with skills development and informal \neconomy processes \nThe construction sector in Build  countries is usually \npredominantly informal, characterised by a lack of \nregulation, inadequate working conditions and limited \naccess to finance and technical expertise. Moreover, \nthe skills and knowledge gap among professionals \nand workers in sustainable construction methods \nand material handling often hampers the integration \nof circular principles into design, construction and \nbuilding management. \n• Establish and fund training programmes and \nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training \n(TVET) courses  that equip local stakeholders with \nthe necessary skills and knowledge to implement \ncircular construction techniques, and improve \nknowledge of health and safety standards. Such \nprogrammes should make efforts to target \nmigrant workers, who often make up a majority of \nconstruction jobs. This special focus would address \nthe lack of expertise and develop a workforce \ncapable of delivering circular projects. 122 \n• Design, revise and update curricula to include \nrelevant skills  related to planning, designing, \nbuilding and managing circular built environments. \nEmbed circular economy thinking early in education \nto help train the next generation, and improve \nwomen’s access to the labour market by identifying \nopportunities across the entire value chain, from \ndesign to maintenance to end-of-life. The private \nsector, national government and skills agencies \nof each country need to work together to set this \ndirection and ensure that the provision of training \nmatches demand.\n• Ensure community participation  by involving \nlocal workers and businesses in decision-making \nfor construction projects, ensuring their needs and \ncultural values are considered, thus overcoming \nresistance and promoting community buy-in. Social \nprotection policies  can mitigate adverse impacts \nwhile supporting the transition's progression.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT BUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n65\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n64\n\n\nRWANDA’S CIRCULAR ECONOMY \nACTION PLAN EMBEDS \nCIRCULAR PRINCIPLES INTO THE \nCONSTRUCTION SECTOR.\nRwanda is experiencing the second \nhighest economic growth rate in Sub-\nSaharan Africa due to its booming \npopulation, an emerging middle class \nand increasing urbanisation. That being \nsaid, this economic upswing has brought \nunsustainable building practices along \nwith it—currently, standards related to \nbuildings’ design phase do not require \ncriteria for extended life cycles or a safe \ncycling of materials. Materials used for \nconstruction are largely imported, with \nonly a minority produced locally. While it \nwould serve the industry well to reduce \nits dependence on foreign imports \nof steel and cement—both lessening \nenvironmental impacts and building \nresilience—a lack of awareness and \nacceptance of circularity in the private \nsector and a lack of legal and financial \nincentives are preventing this.\nTo combat this, Rwanda’s Ministry of \nEnvironment published a Circular Economy \nAction Plan and Roadmap 123 in 2023. This \nAction Plan provides a clear vision for \nRwanda’s construction sector: to design, \nconstruct and use buildings in alignment \nwith circular principles and valorise \nconstruction and demolition waste \n(C&DW) in ways that enable high-quality \nreuse, recycling and recovery. The Action \nPlan outlines three priorities for the built \nenvironment in Rwanda alongside the \npractical solutions to make them possible. \nFirst, a revised national Building Code \nand the use of the Green Building \nCompliance System  should be enforced. \nThis means including circular principles in \nthe Rwanda Green Building Compliance \nSystem, and ensuring this system is applied \nto all buildings. Trainings and workshops \nshould be held that provide clear guidance \non the right application of the Building \nCode and the Compliance System, which \ncould be offered to construction companies \nby the Green Building Organisation and the \nRwanda Housing Authority. Ideally, each \nconstruction firm would have one or two \nin-house experts familiar with the Building \nCode and Compliance System, to help make \ncircular buildings the new normal.\nSecond, the Action Plan advises that \nrenewable and local materials and \nconstruction types should be prioritised \nbefore exhausting non-renewable \nmaterials.  This will entail using alternative \nconstruction materials as well as more \nlocal construction types like rammed earth \nconstruction. To carry this out, vocational \ntraining and guidelines for the informal \nsector must be developed on how to shift \nfrom conventional to local alternative \nconstruction materials and how to better \nintegrate into the formal sector.\nFinally, the Action Plan calls for the \ndevelopment of national guidelines \non how to characterise and valorise \nConstruction and Demolition Waste \n(C&DW).  National guidelines should \ninclude a transitory plan and clear \nguidance for construction companies and \nrecyclers to identify different types of \nwaste, which is essential for choosing the \nmost appropriate recycling or recovering \ntechnique. Techniques and enablers for \ndismantling, repairing and reusing building \nelements should also be established to \nprevent demolition and keep materials \nin use at their highest value. Lastly, the \nguidelines should contain guidance on \nhow to recycle different types of C&DW \nin the most circular way: avoiding low-\ngrade applications such as backfilling, for \nexample\nIt may be too soon to measure the impacts \nof the Circular Economy Action Plan and \nRoadmap  in Rwanda, but the Plan serves \nas a huge step in the right direction to \ntransforming a wasteful and material-\nintensive industry. What’s more, the Plan’s \npotential impacts transcend borders, \noffering a replicable framework for \ncountries with similar economies to work \ntowards a more circular built environment. \nEmpowering ALL workers \nthrough training and upskilling \nis the lifeblood propelling \nthe transition to a circular \neconomy.\nEllen Hoeijenbos, Netherlands \nTrade Union Confederation (FNV)\n67\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n66\n\n\nWHO\n7\nNEEDS  \n   TO DO \nHOW TO DRIVE \nACTION\nWorking towards a global circular economy is undeniably \nambitious, and won’t be without its fair share of hurdles—but \nwe can get there. In aligning material use with societal needs, \nwe envision a world where the needs of all people are met \nwithin the safe boundaries of the planet. As illustrated in \nthis Report, a systems-oriented approach will be imperative \nto move from theory to action and achieve this collective \nvision of a safe and just space. This chapter highlights the key \nstakeholders that can create an enabling environment for \ncircular economy solutions to thrive, effectively transforming \nkey systems: among these are countries’ Ministries of Finance, \nEnvironment and Labour, labour unions, Multinational \nDevelopment Banks (MDBs), financial institutions, educational \ninstitutions, and the private sector. No one actor can spur \nchange alone: the transition calls for radical collaboration \nand concerted efforts to avoid burden shifting among \nindustries, regions and resources—striving for a harmonious \ntransformation of production and consumption. Let us set \nthe stage for a global economy that operates by new rules—\nones that promote a level playing field and propel us toward a \nmore sustainable and equitable future.\nWHAT\n68\n 69\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n\n\nWORK TOGETHER: \nReform international \nfinancial and trade \narchitecture to ensure all \nnations have the means \nto invest in sustainable \ndevelopment.\nSHIFT THE GOALPOSTS: \nPlace materials at the \ncentre of the story of \nachieving wellbeing within \nboundaries.\nHOW?\n• Reform international financial and trade \npatterns to promote circular solutions.  This will \nbe critical to unlock the potential of the circular \neconomy to improve and sustain social outcomes \nfor nations while respecting environmental \nlimits.126, 127 The private sector must be part of the \ntransformation, but reducing risks that attract \nprivate finance for development is crucial. These \nendeavours should be carried out at the local level, \nwith robust public oversight. This approach is vital \nto prevent low-income countries from becoming \noverly reliant on the current structure of value \nchains and global financial capital. 128 \nHOW?\n• Develop and apply holistic indicators.  We must \nmove beyond GDP and other traditional economic \nmetrics to incorporate indicators that measure the \nthings that matter to people: from environmental \nhealth to social equity, decent work and human \nwellbeing. This is necessary to sketch a clearer picture \nof how—and to what end—economies are progressing \nand developing. Better data and indicators are \nneeded to show how environmental and economic \nactivities can promote human wellbeing, including \nthrough decent job opportunities. 124\n• Set mission-oriented targets.  New targets are \nneeded to shift the goal from maximising economic \noutput to maximising human wellbeing within \nplanetary boundaries. Add to existing targets for \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by setting \ncaps on total material use and waste generation that \nprogressively and rapidly decline until sustainable \nlevels are reached—and do so at the needed speed, \nscope and scale to achieve intended outcomes. 125 \nAt the same time, ensure that the development of \nthese environmental targets is adaptive and dynamic: \nit must centre on building resilience while being \nresponsive to emerging challenges, technological \nadvancements and changing societal needs in our \nincreasingly uncertain and rapidly evolving world.\n• Increase fair access to affordable circular and \ngreen technological innovations.  Introducing \nintellectual property rights (IPRs) waivers can \nsupport technological transfer to improve access to \nnecessary existing technologies, while rethinking \ntrade policy will also foster necessary innovation \nin Build countries. 129 This can apply to clean energy \ntechnologies, technological innovation for resource-\nefficient industrial processes, alternative protein \ntechnologies, and more. This can enable Build \ncountries to leapfrog and ‘bend the curve’. 130 \n• Roll out measures for debt cancellation and \nrelief. Currently, despite contributing the least to \nclimate change, many Build and Grow nations have \naccrued substantial debts, making it extremely \ndifficult for them to prioritise sustainable and low-\ncarbon investments. Debt cancellation and relief \nfor Build and Grow countries is essential because \nit frees up financial resources—enabling these \nnations to invest in the circular economy transition, \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, ecosystem \nrestoration, and resilience-building measures rather \nthan funnelling their limited resources into debt \nrepayment. 131, 132 Shift countries can directly support \nthese efforts, particularly by ensuring multilateral \nfinancial institutions provide direct funding and \nprioritise access to affordable capital. 133\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economy, Finance \nand the Environment,\nBusiness leaders,\nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development \n(OECD), \nInternational Financial Institutions \n(such as the IMF and Development \nBanks).\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economics, Finance \nand Trade,\nInternational Financial Institutions,\nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe World Trade Organization).\n71\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n70\n\n\nGET THE ECONOMICS \nRIGHT SO FINANCING \nCAN FOLLOW: Roll out \nambitious environmental \nfiscal reforms that realign \neconomic incentives \nwith the objectives of the \ncircular economy to ensure \nthat the private sector \nand financiers drive and \naccelerate the transition.\nFORGE GLOBAL \nCOLLABORATION FOR A \nJUST TRANSITION: Align \nenvironmental goals with \nsocial and economic ones \nacross the world.\nHOW?\n• Redesign taxation to ensure that prices reflect \nand include all costs.  This should include those \nlinked to environmental and health impacts, and \ncan be done through carbon pricing and resource \ntaxes, for example. 134 Similarly, subsidies must be \nredirected away from high-impact activities and \nproducts—from meat 135 and SUVs to fast fashion \nand air travel—and towards activities with positive \nimpact: those that minimise raw material extraction, \nregenerate ecosystems and provide social value. 136 \nPublic support can be funnelled into these activities \nthrough tax deductions, preferential investment \nHOW?\n• Ensure the circular economy transition is people-\ncentric.  As important as what needs to be done to \ntackle climate breakdown, it’s also how these things \nare done that matters. As people—citizens, workers \nand employers—lie at the core of all economies, \nshifting how our economies function requires \npeople-centred approaches. Working towards a just \ntransition means leaving no one behind. \n• Build substantial support and leadership \namong governments around the world for \nthis social transition to take place. The time \nis ripe for a modern version of Franklin D. \nRoosevelt’s New Deal 141 to address economic \ninequality, infrastructure investment, social \nconditions and subsidies. \n• Dismantle incentives for excessive material \nconsumption.  Modern societies are marked by \nstark inequalities, with some living on very little \nwhile others consume excessively, driving the \nlion’s share of environmental damage. A key way to \naddress this systemic issue is through the taxation \nof luxury goods. 137 By doing so, we can not only \ncurb excessive consumption but also channel the \ngenerated revenue into public goods. These public \ngoods, such as improved public transport, parks and \nhealthcare, have the potential to benefit everyone, \nfostering a shift from a scenario of public neglect \nand private opulence to one of private sufficiency \nand public prosperity. 138\n• Complement pricing signals with fee-and-\ndividend schemes. 139 While true pricing is \nnecessary, it can’t steer change alone. Other \nmechanisms can also complement and reinforce \nbetter pricing, with the ultimate aim of limiting \ninflation and fostering social support for profound \nchanges. For example, fee-and-dividend approaches \nthat collect revenue from societies most polluting \nactivities and directed towards essential services \nthat mitigate impacts that disproportionately affect \nthe most vulnerable in society. Raised proceeds \non different assets—from carbon emissions and \nraw material extraction to land value to personal \ndata—can be recirculated, mitigating potential \ndisproportionate impacts on the poor. 140\nwelfare and environmental sustainability. \nTransitioning towards a circular economy requires \nstate planning, strong social policy and the \nimplementation of specialised public labour \nagencies that manage the transition of workers. \nSocial protection policies should ensure that all \nworkers can be supported and benefit from the \ntransition.\n• Harness policymakers’ creativity to achieve \nresults within a tight timeframe. This entails the \ndevelopment of subsidised green contracts and \njob guarantees. In Shift  countries, job guarantees \nand Just Transition Funds can be used to support \nworkers in resource-intensive industries that will \nundergo changes, both in their own countries \nand in partner Grow  and Build  countries. These \nhave already been rolled out in the EU and the US, \nfor example; while the International Just Energy \nTransition Partnership between South Africa, \nFrance, Germany, the UK and the US could be used \nas an example to learn from. \n• Ensure education addresses the inevitable \nshift in jobs and skills. It is vital that the right \nbasic education, vocational education and training \n(VET) and lifelong learning opportunities are made \navailable now. Investment in and support for VET \nreforms should be a high priority, and aligned with \nindustrial and environmental strategies. In parallel \nto foundational courses, micro-certifications \nshould be developed in order to meet immediate \ndemand in some sectors. Companies should also \nbe encouraged to invest in new green skills so \ntheir workers are equipped for the future. \n• Ensure that circular, green employment \nmeans better employment.  This includes \nbetter representation, decent pay and improved \nworking conditions. No matter what corner of \nthe world or the value chain we find ourselves \nin, it is crucial that people everywhere have the \nopportunity to lead dignified lives. Work is a \ncentral part of delivering on that goal, and social \ndialogue, social protection and skills development \nfor a sustainable economy is universally needed. \nWorkers across industries must be given the \nsecurity and insurance that their working \nconditions and lives will improve as a result of the \ntransition, not deteriorate. Unemployment and \nviolent geographical relocations must be avoided \nto the greatest extent possible, while workers’ \ninterests must be protected in the transition.\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economy and Finance,\nAcademic and educational \ninstitutions, \nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe World Trade Organization and \nthe OECD),\nInternational Financial Institutions \n(such as the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank).\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economy and Labour,\nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe UN, the World Trade \nOrganization and the World Bank),\nLabour agencies and unions,\nBusiness leaders and,\nEducational institutions. \n73\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n72\n\n\nENDNOTES\n1.

We explored the data of 148 countries between the years \nof 2005 and 2015 and identified that a handful of high-in-\ncome nations—which have the highest standards of human \ndevelopment—still pour in more resources every year, but \nwith no further impact to human wellbeing. Norway is re-\nnowned for having one of the highest HDI scores on earth, \nbut also one of the highest material footprints, standing at \n44 tonnes per capita—nearly four times the global average. \nDespite continued growth in material footprint (>1.2), there \nhas been no average progress on socioeconomic indicators \n(<0.01). Similarly, Singapore and Lithuania had the largest \nmaterial footprint increases of the 148 countries studied in \nthe period 2005 to 2015, yet Lithuania recorded no average \ngrowth across wellbeing indicators, and Singapore achieved \nonly a very small average increase, mostly by increasing \nemployment. \n15.

In this report, consumption refers \nto absolute consumption.\nCycling refers to the process of converting a material \ninto a material or product of a higher (upcycling), same \n(recycling) or lower (downcycling) embodied value and/\nor complexity than it originally was.\nDomestic Extraction (DE)  is an environmental \nindicator that measures, in physical weight, the \namount of raw materials extracted from the natural \nenvironment for use in any economy. It excludes water \nand air. [Source]\nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC)  is an \nenvironmental indicator that covers the flows of \nboth products and raw materials by accounting for \ntheir mass. It can take an ‘apparent consumption’ \nperspective—the mathematical sum of domestic \nproduction and imports, minus exports—without \nconsidering changes in stocks. It can also take a ‘direct \nconsumption’ perspective, in that products for import \nand export do not account for the inputs—be they raw \nmaterials or other products—used in their production. \n[Own elaboration based on Source ]\nEconomy-wide material flow accounts (EW-MFA)  \nare a 'statistical accounting framework describing the \nphysical interaction of the economy with the natural \nenvironment and with the rest of the world economy in \nterms of flows of materials.' [ Source]\nEnvironmental stressor , in Input-Output Analysis, is \ndefined as the environmental impact occurring within \nthe region subject to analysis. There is, therefore, \nan overlap between the stressor and the footprint, \nas they both include the share of impact occurring \nwithin a region as a result of domestic consumption. \nThis is how they differ: while the rest of the stressor \nis made up of impacts occurring within a region as a \nresult of consumption abroad (embodied in exports), \nthe footprint includes impacts occurring abroad \nas a result of domestic consumption (embodied in \nimports).\nGreenhouse gases (GHG)  refers to a group of \ngases contributing to global warming and climate \nbreakdown. The term covers seven greenhouse \ngases divided into two categories. Converting them \nto carbon dioxide equivalents  (CO2e) through the \napplication of characterisation factors makes it \npossible to compare them and to determine their \nindividual and total contributions to Global Warming \nPotential (see below). [ Source]\nHigh-value recycling  refers to the extent to \nwhich, through the recycling chain, the distinct \ncharacteristics of a material (the polymer, the glass \nor the paper fibre, for example) are preserved or \nrecovered so as to maximise their potential to be re-\nused in a circular economy. [ Source]\nMaterials , substances or compounds are used as \ninputs to production or manufacturing because \nof their properties. A material can be defined at \ndifferent stages of its life cycle: unprocessed (or \nraw) materials, intermediate materials and finished \nmaterials. For example, iron ore is mined and \nprocessed into crude iron, which in turn is refined \nand processed into steel. Each of these can be \nreferred to as materials. [ Source]\nMaterial footprint , also referred to as Raw Material \nConsumption (RMC), is the attribution of global \nmaterial extraction to the domestic final demand of a \ncity. In this sense, the material footprint represents the \ntotal volume of materials (in Raw Material Equivalents) \nembodied within the whole supply chain to meet final \ndemand. The total material footprint, as referred to \nin this report, is the sum of the material footprints \nfor biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic \nminerals. It is composed of the sum of domestic \nextraction and imports in raw material equivalents, \nminus exports in raw material equivalents. This \nallows us to allocate the footprint to the consumption. \n[Source]\nMaterial flows represent the amounts of materials \nin physical weight that are available to an economy. \nThese material flows comprise the extraction of \nmaterials within the economy as well as the physical \nimports and exports (such as the mass of goods \nimported or exported). Air and water are generally \nexcluded. [ Source]\nNet Extraction Abroad (NEA) represents the \ndifference between the trade balance of products and \nthat of the raw materials needed to produce them. The \ndifference between the two represents the 'actual' or \nnet quantity of raw materials that have been extracted \nabroad to satisfy domestic consumption.\nPlanetary boundaries  define the ‘safe operating \nspace’ for humanity, based on the planet’s key \nbiophysical processes. Originally developed by \nRockstr öm et al. (2009), the framework quantifies \nnine ‘limits’: 1. Climate change, 2. Novel entities, 336 3. \nStratospheric ozone depletion, 4. Atmospheric aerosol \nloading, 5. Ocean acidification, 6. Biogeochemical flows \n(nitrogen and phosphorus), 7. Freshwater use, 8. Land-\nsystem change, and 9. Biosphere integrity. 337 Six of \nnine boundaries have now been transgressed. [ Source]\nRaw Material Equivalent (RME)  is a virtual unit that \nmeasures how much of a material was extracted \nfrom the environment, domestically or abroad, \nto produce the product for final use. Imports and \nexports in RME are usually much higher than their \ncorresponding physical weight, especially for finished \nand semi-finished products. For example, traded \ngoods are converted into their RME to obtain a more \ncomprehensive picture of the ‘material footprints’; \nthe amounts of raw materials required to provide the \nrespective traded goods. [ Source]\nRaw Material Consumption (RMC)  represents the \nfinal domestic use of products in terms of RME. RMC, \nreferred to in this report as the 'material footprint', \ncaptures the total amount of raw materials required \nto produce the goods used by the economy. In other \nwords, the material extraction necessary to enable the \nfinal use of products. [ Source]\nResources  include, for example, arable land, \nfreshwater, and materials. They are seen as parts \nof the natural world that can be used for economic \nactivities that produce goods and services. Material \nresources are biomass (like crops for food, energy \nand bio-based materials, as well as wood for energy \nand industrial uses), fossil fuels (in particular coal, gas \nand oil for energy), metals (such as iron, aluminium \nand copper used in construction and electronics \nmanufacturing) and non-metallic minerals (used for \nconstruction, notably sand, gravel and limestone). \n[Source]\nSecondary materials  are materials that have been \nused once and are recovered and reprocessed for \nsubsequent use. This refers to the amount of the \noutflow which can be recovered to be re-used or \nrefined to re-enter the production stream. One \naim of dematerialisation is to increase the amount \nof secondary materials used in production and \nconsumption to create a more circular economy. \n[Source]\n81\n80\nThe Circularity Gap Report | Munich\n\nSector  describes any collective of economic actors \ninvolved in creating, delivering and capturing value for \nconsumers, tied to their respective economic activity. \nWe apply different levels of aggregation here—aligned \nwith classifications as used in Exiobase V3. These \nrelate closely to the European sector classification \nframework NACE Rev. 2.\nSocioeconomic cycling  is the technical term for \nthe Socioeconomic Cycling metric. It comprises all \ntypes of recycled and downcycled end-of-life waste, \nwhich is fed back into production as secondary \nmaterials. Recycled waste from material processing \nand manufacturing (such as recycled steel scrap from \nautobody manufacturing, for example) is considered \nan internal industry flow and is not counted as a \nsecondary material. In the underlying model of the \nphysical economy used in this report, secondary \nmaterials originate from discarded material stocks \nonly. The outflows from the dissipative use of \nmaterials and combusted materials (energy use) can, \nby definition, not be recycled. Biological materials that \nare returned back to the environment (for example, \nthrough spreading on land) as opposed to recirculated \nin technical cycles (for example, recycled wood) are \nnot included as part of socioeconomic cycling. Energy \nrecovery (electricity, district heat) from the incineration \nof fossil or biomass waste is also not considered to \nbe socioeconomic cycling, as it does not generate \nsecondary materials.\nSocioeconomic metabolism  describes how \nsocieties metabolise energy and materials to remain \noperational. Just as our bodies undergo complex \nchemical reactions to keep our cells healthy and \nfunctioning, a city undergoes a similar process—\nenergy and material flows are metabolised to express \nfunctions that serve humans and the reproduction of \nstructures. Socioeconomic metabolism focuses on the \nbiophysical processes that allow for the production \nand consumption of goods and services that serve \nhumanity: namely, what and how goods are produced \n(and for which reason), and by whom they are \nconsumed. [ Source]\nTerritorial-based carbon footprint  is based on the \ntraditional accounting method for GHG emissions, \nwith a focus on domestic emissions, mainly coming \nfrom final energy consumption. A consumption-\nbased carbon footprint uses input–output modelling \nto not only account for domestic emissions but also \nconsider those that occur along the supply chain \nof consumption (for example, accounting for the \nembodied carbon of imported products). \nTotal material consumption  is calculated by adding \nRaw Material Consumption (material footprint) and \nsecondary material consumption (cycled materials).\n83\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n82\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nCircle Economy Foundation would like to thank the \nfunders, authors, contributors and interviewees for \ntheir contribution to the preparation of this edition \nof the Circularity Gap Report.

      "content": "Despite the circular economy entering the \nmainstream, global circularity is still in \ndecline. \nOver the past five years, the volume of discussions, \ndebates, and articles addressing this topic has almost \ntripled, reflecting a heightened awareness and interest \nin circularity. 1 However, the vast majority of extracted \nmaterials entering the economy are virgin, with the \nshare of secondary materials declining steadily since \nthe Circularity Gap Report began measuring it: from \n9.1% in 2018 to 7.2% just five years later in 2023. \nMeanwhile, the total amount of materials consumed by \nthe global economy continues to rise: in just the past \nsix years alone we have consumed over half a trillion \ntonnes of materials—nearly as much as the entirety \nof the 20th century. These statistics display the cold, \nhard truth: despite the circular economy reaching \n‘megatrend’ status, lofty speeches and targets are \nnot yet translating into on-the-ground actions and \nmeasurable impacts. Without bold, urgent action to \nshift to a circular economy, we'll miss out on achieving \nbroader social and environmental goals—ranging from \nemissions reductions to boosting the use of secondary \nmaterials—putting industries and governments at risk \nof sleepwalking into circular washing and missing out \non much-needed impact. \nThe Circularity Gap Reports  have provided \ncrucial analysis and theory on the global \nstate of circularity since 2019. Now, it's time \nto put this theory into action. \nToday, six of the nine key ‘planetary boundaries’ that \nmeasure environmental health across land, water and \nair have been broken—largely due to the impacts of the \nlinear ‘take-make-waste’ economy. Our Circularity Gap \nReport 2023  found that adopting 16 circular economy \nsolutions could not only reverse the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries but also slash the global need \nfor material extraction by one-third. This reduction \nis rooted in the circular economy principles of using \nless for longer, using regenerative materials and \ncycling materials at their end-of-life. At this moment \nin time, we've never needed a circular economy more. \nWhile material consumption has been instrumental in \nraising living standards over the past century, we've \nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\nreached a unique point in history where its continued \nacceleration—in high-income countries—no longer \nguarantees  increases in human wellbeing. Meanwhile, \nthe unequal distribution of wealth and materials \nhugely destabilise society and strains Earth's life \nsupport systems. The world's wealthier nations can \nno longer use progress as an excuse for unrestricted \nmaterial consumption. The global economy needs to \nadopt circular principles to boost development and \nresilience and to safeguard people's wellbeing in this \ntime of uncertainty and transition. \nTo walk the talk, governments and industry \nmust break free of flawed development \npatterns that continue to fuel industries \nand practices known to be socially and \nenvironmentally exploitative.\nThey can do this by unlocking capital, rolling out \nbold, contextually-appropriate policies and closing \nthe sustainable and circular skills gap. In this year’s \nReport, we shift from exploring the what  to the how : \nexploring the different ways that we need to ‘change \nthe rules of the game’ and create a set of conditions \nthat discourage the overshoot of planetary boundaries \nand ‘undershoot’ of human development. This process \nhas resulted in us spotlighting 12 of the original 16 \nsolutions, highlighting the country profile that they are \nmost relevant to, as well as placing people at the centre \nof this story for the first time. Based on extensive \ninterviews and desk research, this Report aims to show \ngovernments and industry leaders that if they want \nto turn theory into action and scale an economy that \ndelivers on needs within the safe limits of the planet, \nthey need to dismantle harmful entrenched processes \nand align enabling elements:\n• Create a level policy playing field: Set the ‘rules \nof the game’ through policies and legal frameworks \nthat incentivise sustainable and circular practices \nwhile penalising harmful ones, thereby shaping \nthe nature and scale of economic activities across \nindustries and nations. \n• Get the economics right: Adjust fiscal policies and \nleverage public investment to create true prices and \nensure that circular solutions become more valuable \ninstruments and begin to replace linear norms.\n• Build circular expertise and skills: Ensure people \nare skilled and trained to ensure a just transition \nwhere opportunities and decent livelihoods are \nfairly distributed across and within societies.\nFor a just transition, we must take a systems-\nthinking approach in real-life applications of \nthe circular economy—both because systems \nchange must meet people’s needs and \nbecause people and their skills are necessary \nto implement the solutions themselves. \nAlthough human wellbeing is a broad concept that \nencompasses a range of social, emotional and physical \nfactors, this Report specifically focuses on how the \ncircular transition can support wellbeing through the \nprovision of decent work. Jobs act as a robust proxy \nfor human wellbeing as it speaks to many dimensions \nof the human experience: jobs fulfil concrete needs \nlike financial security while also providing a sense of \nmeaning and fulfilment, community and social mobility. \nDecent and meaningful livelihoods are the bedrock of \nthriving societies. This is why circular solutions must \nbe designed with the world’s most vulnerable in mind. \nDone right, the circular economy can do more than \ncreate jobs and deliver on people’s basic needs—it can \nelevate job quality and safety and reduce inequalities \nacross entire workforces and, with this, populations.\nA future-proof system must galvanise \nwellbeing by funnelling materials into \nindustries and practices that lift people \nup and repair the damage done to the \necosystems upon which we depend, while \ndegrowing harmful ones—especially in \nhigher-income countries. \nKey global systems put the most pressure on key \nEarth systems, driving us past the safe limits of six \nplanetary boundaries. However, these systems are vital \nfor fulfilling people’s needs. In this report, we focus \non transformative circular solutions across three key \nsystems:\nTHE FOOD SYSTEM nourishes populations and employs \n50% of the global workforce, but:\n• it currently drives a quarter of the overshoot on \nthe climate change planetary boundary due to its \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) production, \n• animal farming alone uses over one-quarter of all \nland, equivalent to the size of the Americas, 2\n• nearly a quarter of freshwater resources are lost due \nto rampant food waste, and\n• it is the single largest driver of biodiversity loss. 3\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,  including housing, \ncommercial buildings and the necessary \ninfrastructure for mobility, is essential for our \nlivelihoods, but:\n• the extraction of minerals used to produce \nconstruction materials is responsible for a quarter \nof global land use change,\n• approximately 40% of global GHG emissions can \nbe attributed to buildings’ construction, use and \ndemolition, and\n• construction and demolition processes drive nearly \none-third of all material consumption.\nMANUFACTURED GOODS,  such as vehicles, textiles, \nappliances and equipment and their associated \nproduction processes are big employers but:\n• production processes often rely on fossil fuels and \ncurrently drive one-third of the overshoot on the \nclimate change planetary boundary due to its GHG \nproduction,\n• material- and energy-intensive industrial activities \nare linked to deforestation and drive 15% on both \nthe land use and freshwater planetary boundaries, \n• manufacturing goods results in substantial \namounts of hazardous industrial waste and leaks \nchemicals into the environment.\nTo achieve global wellbeing within \nplanetary boundaries, we must prioritise \ncircularity-based development in lower-\nincome Build countries, promote circular \nindustrial processes in Grow  countries \nand shift consumption patterns in higher-\nincome Shift nations.\nUltimately, different countries will have different \npriorities in scaling a global circular economy and \nensuring that materials funnel into systems and \npractices that boost wellbeing within the safe limits of \nthe planet.\n9\n8\n8\n",

Despite housing around 17% of \nthe global population, they consume one-fourth \n(25%) of raw materials, and consume the most non-\nmetallic minerals and fossil fuels per capita of all \ncountry profiles. On average, Shift  countries’ per capita \nmaterial footprint of 22.6 tonnes is 4.6 times that of \nBuild countries (largely due to the overconsumption of \nconsumer goods imported from Grow  countries) and \n1.6 times that of Grow  countries. They also generate \n43% of global emissions. This country profile’s mission \nwill be to reduce its material consumption and \nultimately, lessen its impact on planetary boundaries, \nwhich currently comes at the expense of the global \nmajority.\nMiddle-income Grow countries should \nstabilise their material consumption.\nGrow countries—including, for example, China, \nIndonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam, Myanmar and \nEgypt—need to continue improving their people's \nquality of life, but in a way that is much more sensitive \nto planetary boundaries. Globally, they account for \n51% of the material footprint, while housing around \n37% of the global population. Their average per capita \nmaterial footprint is 17 tonnes per year. While these \ncountries contribute 41% of global emissions—almost \nas much as Shift  countries—their share of the global \npopulation is double that of Shift  countries.\nIncreased growth and incomes have led to a nutrition \ntransformation: diets are increasingly shifting in \nfavour of more animal-based proteins—such as \nmeat and dairy—and processed foods. While many \ncountries are and will likely remain key manufacturing \nand industrial hubs for the rest of the world’s—\nand their own—consumption, this necessitates a \nshift to make this sustainable environmentally and \nsupportive and safe for workers.\nLower-income Build countries should \nincrease their material consumption to \nfulfil their populations’ needs.\nBuild countries, such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, \nPakistan, the Philippines, and some small island states, \nfor example, account for 18.5% of the global material \nfootprint, despite being home to almost half (46%) \nof the population. Their material footprint per capita \nis just 5 tonnes per year—less than the estimated \nsustainable level of 8 tonnes per person per year. \nSimilarly, they contribute a relatively small share of \nglobal emissions: just 17%.\nAs these countries generally struggle to meet basic \nneeds for healthcare and education, their primary \nobjective is to improve living standards. This \nnecessitates increased material use to provide the \ninfrastructure, goods and services needed to improve \nwellbeing. It will also require uplifting workers in \nnations with prevalent informal economies, which are \nespecially common in the agricultural, forestry and \nwaste management sectors.\nAlthough much of their \ninfrastructure is already \nbuilt up, Shift  countries still \ncontribute heavily to planetary \nboundary overshoot: \n42% of the overshoot of the \nclimate change boundary\n27% of nitrogen\n18% of phosphorus\n16% of freshwater use\n38% of land use change\nBuild countries make a minimal \ncontribution to the overshoot \nof planetary boundaries, \ncontributing:\n8% of the overshoot of the \nclimate change boundary\n11% of nitrogen\n23% of phosphorus\n30% of freshwater use\n20% of land use change \nboundary\nGrow countries make a large \ncontribution to the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries—largely \nby producing materials to feed \nthe demand of higher-income \n(Shift) countries: \n50% of the overshoot of the \nclimate change boundary\n62% of nitrogen\n60% of phosphorus\n53% of freshwater use\n42% of land use change \n11\n10\n",

This is the ultimate question \nof our time. At present, the global economy under-\ndelivers on many counts: the past years saw the \nemergence of the word ‘polycrisis’: the complex \nentanglement of global geopolitical, economic, \nenvironmental and social dilemmas. 4 And as these \nmultiple crises emerge, interact and worsen, \nwe’re failing to reverse their impacts and secure \na strong social foundation for much of the world’s \npopulation. Rising material consumption and \nexcessive waste drive profound—and increasing—\ndisparities in the distribution of wealth, materials \nand opportunities around the globe. But there is \nanother way: our Circularity Gap Report 2023 5 found \nthat through circular economy solutions, we can \nmeet people’s needs with one-third fewer materials \nthan we use today, reversing the overshoot of five \nplanetary boundaries. This Report takes the next \nstep to uncover the ‘how’ : building on last year’s 16 \nsolutions across four key systems—food, the built \nenvironment, manufactured goods and mobility—it \nspeaks to governments and industry leaders about \nhow they can turn theory into action. It considers \nhow enabling elements—policy, finance shifts and \nthe role of the workforce—can be leveraged to \nsupport the circular transition in all corners of the \nglobe, raising living standards in some places while \nlowering environmental impact. People are central \nto this story: we envision a transition in which no \none is left behind, that is safe and just for workers, \ncitizens and consumers. This Report is a guide: a \npractical action plan for solutions that support \nwellbeing within the planet’s healthy boundaries.\nTHE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST \nCENTURY\nMaterial consumption has been instrumental in \nraising living standards over the past century: \nglobally, a flood of goods, services and energy has \nenhanced life expectancy, increased employment \nand improved education. The visual below, \nhowever, also shows that as living standards—\nmeasured by the Human Development Index \n(HDI)—rise, so does ecological impact. 6,7 We know \nnow that material consumption is a solid proxy for \nenvironmental damage 8 with material handling \nand use contributing 70% of global greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions 9 and extraction and use \ndriving more than 90% of biodiversity loss and \nwater stress, for example. 10\n16\n17\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024",

THE EARTH CAN'T SUSTAIN INFINITE GROWTH IN MATERIAL \nCONSUMPTION\nThe modern economy is underpinned by linear practices that have driven \nexponential growth in material consumption, pollution and waste generation. \nBetween 2016 and 2021, the global economy has consumed 582 billion tonnes of \nmaterials—nearly as many materials as the 740 billion consumed in the entire \n20th century. This puts unsustainable pressure on Earth’s ecosystems and \nbiocapacity, far more than we need to equitably fulfil many societal needs. \n3. THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND MATERIALS \nPUTS IMMENSE STRAIN ON EARTH’S SYSTEMS AND DESTABILISES \nSOCIETIES\nBy exacerbating inequality, spurring political unrest and heightening social \ntension, the global economy’s production and consumption patterns are \nresulting in social unrest, war and mass migration. Climate breakdown is only \nserving to worsen this by further straining access to resources, and shrinking \nthe area of liveable land on Earth.\n2. RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION AND DRIVERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL \nIMPACTS ARE INCREASINGLY UNEQUAL\nA shrinking minority of people are driving the majority of environmental \nimpacts, both between and within nations. High-income nations are key drivers \nof ecological breakdown: EU nations and US alone are responsible for more than \nhalf of the globe’s material consumption, 11 despite housing just around one-\ntenth of the world’s population. The world's wealthiest 1% are responsible for \nthe carbon emissions of the poorest two-thirds, and have accumulated nearly \ndouble the money of the bottom 99%. 12\n4. THE CONTINUED ACCELERATION OF MATERIAL CONSUMPTION \nNO LONGER DELIVERS WELLBEING AND DESIRABLE PROGRESS\nMany high-income nations are at a saturation point: a unique time in history \nwhere increasing material consumption no longer delivers guaranteed \nincreases in human wellbeing. 13 More unequal societies are also unhappier \nones. The world’s wealthier nations can no longer use progress as an excuse for \nunrestricted material consumption. 14\nFigure one shows countries plotted along their Human Development Index and Material Footprint.  \nAs HDI rises, so do environmental impacts. We need a new economic model for the 21st century: one  \nthat maximises benefits for people and minimises the pressure on the planet’s life support systems.\nHuman Development Index (HDI)\nMaterial Footprint per capita\n(displayed as the number of planets needed to sustain \nthe lifestyle of each country’s average citizen)\n1918\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024",

      "content": "BENDING THE CURVE: PROMOTING \nPEOPLE’S WELLBEING WITH SMART \nMATERIAL USE\nRethinking material consumption is crucial for \n‘bending the development curve’ towards a more \nenvironmentally safe and socially just future. Many \ncountries need to expand their economies to build \nmore solid social foundations—often resulting in the \nneed to grow or stabilise material consumption. In \norder to free up ecological space for these countries, \nthose with already strong economies and social \ninfrastructure should reduce their material footprints. \nRedistributing material resources is a critical step to \nensuring universal access to basic needs while staying \nwithin Earth’s safe limits. 15 If countries prioritise \nwellbeing, and better align material consumption \nwith a good quality of life—and make decisions \naccordingly—it is possible to bend development \npathways towards the ‘ecologically safe and socially \njust’ space for humanity. 16\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2023’s research, 17 in which \nwe explored the data of 148 countries between the years \nof 2005 and 2015, aptly illustrates this point. Our analysis \nidentified outlying countries that have taken three \ndistinct development pathways (refer to Chapter two for \nmore information). For one, some countries expanded \ntheir ability to deliver social needs without sharp \nincreases in material demand: countries such as Angola, \nEswatini, Togo, Nepal, the Gambia and South Africa, for \nexample, made strong progress on several wellbeing \nindicators—such as life expectancy, nutrition and access \nto energy—yet had stable, and even declining, material \nfootprints.18 Meanwhile, others injected significant \nvolumes of materials into their economies without any \ndiscernible change in quality of life.\nThe specific factors contributing to each country’s \nindividual development pathway are complex and \nunique, yet these few examples demonstrate the \nimportant point that raw material consumption, and \nthus environmental pressures, can be decoupled from \na high quality of life and standards of wellbeing. 19 This \nis where the circular economy comes in: its principles \nof using less, using longer, making clean and  using again  \ncan be implemented at the product, service, process \nand system levels to deliver a high quality of life to a \ngrowing and increasingly urbanised global population \nwithin the safe limits of the planet. \nThe Circularity Gap Report 2023 findings show that this \nis possible: we can deliver on societal needs such as \nhousing, nutrition, mobility and manufactured goods \nwith 30% less of the materials we use now, reversing \nthe overshoot of five planetary boundaries. \nSLOW\nUSE LONGER\nNARROW\nUSE LESS\nREGENERATE\nMAKE CLEAN\nCYCLE\nUSE AGAIN\nEND/hyphen.caseOF/hyphen.caseLIFE\nFUNCTIONAL\nUSE\nDESIGN\nFigure two depicts the four flows of the circular economy: a comprehensive framework for managing \nresource flows in a circular economy by using less (Narrow), using for longer (Slow), using again (Cycle), \nand using clean, regenerative materials and energy (Regenerate). 20 \nTHE GLOBAL TRANSITION MUST BE JUST \nAND PUT PEOPLE’S WELLBEING AT ITS \nCENTRE \nThe circular economy offers a means to provide for \npeople’s needs with much less environmental impact, \nbut is not socially just by default—it must be designed \nthat way. People-centric solutions are vital, both \nbecause systems change must meet people’s needs \nand because people and their skills are necessary to \nimplement the solutions themselves. Citizens, workers \nand consumers must all be considered in the design \nof circular solutions, to ensure no person, community \nor nation is left behind. The shift towards a ‘circular \nsociety’ 21—in which wellbeing is centre-stage—will not \nbe simple, however. Ambitious circular strategies, while \nwell-intentioned, may be prone to certain negative \neffects—implementing plastics bans without integrating \nmeasures to protect informal recycling workers can \ngenerate unforeseen negative impacts on livelihoods \nand workers’ ability to provide for their families, for \nexample. 22 Social justice must be embedded in policy- \nand decision-making processes to minimise these \nimpacts for those most vulnerable, or to find alternate \nsolutions that benefit people just as much as the planet.\nAlthough human wellbeing is a broad concept that \nencompasses a range of social, emotional and physical \nfactors, this Report specifically focuses on how \nthe circular transition can support wellbeing \nthrough the provision of decent work .23 Jobs act \nas a powerful proxy for human wellbeing as it speaks \nto many dimensions of the human experience: jobs \nfulfil concrete needs like financial security, while \nalso providing a sense of meaning and fulfilment, \ncommunity and social mobility. Decent and meaningful \nlivelihoods are the bedrock of thriving societies. This \nis why circular solutions must be designed with the \nworld’s most vulnerable in mind. Done right, the \ncircular economy can do more than simply create jobs \nand deliver on people’s basic needs—it can elevate job \nquality and safety, and reduce inequalities across entire \nworkforces and with this, populations.\nWorkers are also consumers . The average citizen should \nhave easy access to affordable solutions—be they in the \nform of goods or services—that provide greater value \nthan their linear counterparts. To this end, this report \nalso explores some consumer-centred solutions that \nsupport citizens in making more sustainable choices, \nholding politicians accountable and championing \nbottom-up initiatives. This is not to shift responsibility \nfrom businesses and governments to the every-day \nconsumer, but rather to highlight the importance of \naligning incentives with people’s needs: engineering a \ncircular economy with and for people. \nDrawing on the findings of the Circularity Gap Report \n2023, this report identifies impactful circular solutions \ntailored to different country profiles based on their \nenvironmental impact, their potential for positive \nsocio-ecological impact, and—ultimately—the unique \nmakeup of their economies, which feeds into what \ntheir people need and want.\n1. To pinpoint key leverage points for \neach country profile. Build, Grow and \nShift  countries all have a role to play \nin the transition—but these roles will \nlook different. This report uncovers \nthe most important value chains \nto transition to a circular economy \nacross these three country profiles.\n2. To move from theory to action:  \nprevious Circularity Gap Reports have \ndefined the ‘ what ’—this report lays \nout the ‘ how ’ to put these solutions \ninto action. \n3. Explore and raise awareness for \ncircular enablers.  We know which \nsolutions must be rolled out at scale \nto transform our economic system \nand boost circularity around the \nworld.

      "content": "FOUR VITAL GLOBAL SYSTEMS \nDRIVE THE MAJORITY OF \nECOLOGICAL OVERSHOOT  \nLast year’s Circularity Gap Report  found that by \napplying just 16 circular solutions across four \nglobal systems, we can reverse the overshoot \nof five planetary boundaries and limit warming \ntemperatures to 2-degrees. While each of these \n16 solutions is applicable to all nations, certain \nsolutions may have higher impact and relevance in \ncertain geographies. \nWe can identify which circular solutions are the most \napplicable to each country profile by looking at the \nlocations of global production and consumption, trade \npatterns, labour market characteristics, the way in \nwhich countries consume materials and the way in \nwhich future socio-economic trends will shape material \nconsumption. \nIn doing so, we can single out leverage points in the \nglobal economy where specific activities, practices and \nmaterials create a disproportionate level of impact. \nThis process has resulted in us spotlighting 12 of the \noriginal 16 solutions, highlighting the country profile \nthat they are most relevant to.\nMAINSTREAM REGENERATIVE \nAGRICULTURE\nScale up agricultural practices that \nregenerate ecosystems, recirculate nutrients \nand sequester carbon by design.\nPUT HEALTHIER, SATIATING FOODS \nFIRST\nPrioritise satiating and healthy foods with a \nlower environmental impact—ideally shifting \ncalories from meat, fish and dairy towards \ncereals, fruits, vegetables and nuts.\nFOOD SYSTEM\nGlobally, the food system employs half of the global \nworkforce and is a key driver of the overshoot of \nmany planetary boundaries, responsible for: a \nquarter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 44% \nof global land use, 61% of freshwater withdrawal \nand 90% of phosphorus emissions to soil. Animal \nagriculture, intensive land management practices \nand food waste contribute the vast majority of \nthese impacts. Animal farming alone uses more \nthan a quarter of all land, releases almost 15% of \nGHG emissions and is responsible for two-thirds \nof all phosphorus emissions and one–third of all \nnitrogen emissions—enough to tip us past the \nboundary for nutrient overload. And while we \ntechnically produce enough food to feed everyone, \naround 800 million people still live in hunger. 24 The \nproduction of food that is either lost or wasted \naccounts for nearly a quarter of global cropland, \nup to 10% of GHG emissions, and nearly a quarter \nof the total freshwater resources used for food \nproduction. \nA circular food system must address the whole \nvalue chain, from production to consumption to \nwaste management. The four key solutions for the \nfood system are:\nGO LOCAL, SEASONAL AND \nORGANIC\nPrioritise the production and consumption \nof local, seasonal and organic produce \n(sometimes in combination with GMO to \nreduce pests and disease loss on crops), \nwhich can lead to a significantly reduced \nneed for chemical inputs, fuels, and \nprocessing services that contribute most to \nenvironmental impacts.\nEND AVOIDABLE FOOD WASTE\nMinimise food loss and valorise waste \nfollowing the food waste hierarchy along \nthe supply chain and at the consumer level \nthrough better management of transport \nand storage, more refrigeration and smart \nplanning, and technology at the consumer \nand food service levels.\n*The mobility system has not been included in this selection: \nthis is because the kinds of circular solutions that address \nmobility assets—vehicles like cars and bicycles to trains \nand aeroplanes—fall under the manufacturing system, \nwhile solutions that address mobility infrastructure—such \nas roads, bridges and railways—are considered in the built \nenvironment.\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n26\n",

Despite \nclear divergences between countries, we can still \ndiscern which circular economy interventions will \nbe most suitable in certain contexts based on clear \ncommon needs and structural parallels. We have \nused the country profiles Build , Grow and Shift —first \ndeveloped in the Circularity Gap Report 2020 25—to \nselect the most relevant two key systems and two \ncircular solutions for countries to focus on. \n1. BUY WHAT YOU NEED AND  \nEXTEND THE LIFETIME OF \nMACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND \nGOODS. \nExceeding their fair share of material use, 26 \nthese countries are responsible for the \nbulk of ecological overshoot. 27 Demand for \nraw materials and finished goods—largely \nimported from Grow  countries—means they \noften offshore environmental impacts. Shift  \ncountries must rethink their consumption \npatterns and transform their lifestyles, \neschewing consumerism in favour of \nsufficiency-based approaches. 28\n2. MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT \nALREADY EXISTS AND  PRIORITISE \nCIRCULAR MATERIALS AND \nAPPROACHES.\nIn 2018, stock build-up alone represented \n40% of Shift  countries’ material footprint. \nThis would increase even more if we were to \ninclude materials used to operate buildings \npost-construction—those used for heating \nand cooling, for example. Applying circular \nsolutions to the already built-up built \nenvironment will therefore be a key lever to \nreduce Shift  countries’ impact. \nSHIFT COUNTRY PROFILE\nThese countries are home to around a quarter of \nthe global population, yet consume over one-third \n(34%) of raw materials. \nShift  countries’ material footprint per capita is 4.6 \ntimes that of Build  countries (largely due to the \noverconsumption of consumer goods imported \nfrom Grow counties) and 1.6 times that of Grow \ncountries.\nThese are high-income countries in the Global \nNorth, as well as in the Gulf, Australia and \nOceania. Examples include Member States of the \nEU, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada and Argentina.\nWhile much of their infrastructure is already \nbuilt, they still contribute heavily to the \novershoot of planetary boundaries:  they \ncontribute 42% of climate change, 27% of \nnitrogen, 18% of phosphorus, 16% of freshwater \nuse and 38% of land use change.\nKey development pathways: High-income Shift \ncountries on average enjoy affluent, comfortable \nlifestyles and perform well on social indicators—\nbut they consume far more than their fair share \nof materials. While they house a minority of the \nworld’s population, they generate close to half \nof global emissions and consume the most (per \ncapita) across all material groups. These countries \nmust focus on reducing material extraction and \nuse to lighten their environmental burden.\nTo achieve the above, the most impactful circular solutions \nacross Manufactured goods and the Built environment are:\nPOPULATION RAW MATERIAL CONSUMPTION\n31\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n30\n",

MAINSTREAM REGENERATIVE \nAGRICULTURE AND  GO LOCAL , \nSEASONAL AND ORGANIC.\nAs Grow countries constitute half of the \nworld’s population, they are important food \nconsumer30 and are also the globe’s biggest \nproducers. As well as increased meat and \nprocessed food consumption, food waste \nis also on the rise, especially in the post-\nconsumer stage. 31 \n2. EXTEND THE LIFETIME OF \nMACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND \nGOODS AND  MAINSTREAM \nINDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS AND \nEFFICIENCY.\nDecades of rapid, export-driven \nindustrialisation and low-cost labour have \nmade their mark on these countries: now, \ntransforming their manufacturing systems \nwill be key to reducing environmental impacts \nwhile advancing social progress. They account \nfor around half of the raw materials used \nannually—often driven by demand from \nwealthier nations. \nGROW COUNTRY PROFILE\nGrow countries globally account for 55% of all \nraw material extraction and 52% of the material \nfootprint, while housing around 37% of the global \npopulation.\nThese are larger Southeast Asian countries and \ncountries in Latin America and Northern Africa, \nas well as those with an economy in transition in \nEastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. \nExamples include China, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, \nVietnam, Myanmar and Egypt.\nLarge contribution to the overshoot of \nplanetary boundaries—largely due to the \nconsumptions of local materials in higher-\nincome (Shift ) countries:  these countries \ncontribute 50% of climate change, 62% of \nnitrogen, 60% of phosphorus, 53% of freshwater \nuse and 42% of land use change. \nKey development pathways: Largely middle-\nincome, Grow countries need to continue growing \nto meet their peoples’ needs, but in a way that \nis much more sensitive to the various planetary \nboundaries. Increased growth and income levels \nhave led to a nutrition transformation: diets are \nincreasingly shifting in favour of more animal-\nbased proteins—such as meat and dairy—and \nprocessed foods. 29 While many countries are and \nwill likely remain key manufacturing and industrial \nhubs for the rest of the world’s—and their own—\nconsumption, this necessitates a shift to make this \nsustainable environmentally and supportive and \nsafe for workers.\nTo achieve the above, the most impactful circular solutions \nacross the Food system and Manufactured goods are:\n1.

The countries’ \neconomies are largely agricultural-based, \nwith biomass accounting for nearly half of \ntheir total material consumption. Agriculture \nclaims a large share of employment: four to \nsix out of ten people are employed by the \nsector. 32,33 \n2. PRIORITISE CIRCULAR MATERIALS \nAND APPROACHES AND  REUSE \nWASTE.\nThe continued build-up of housing and \ninfrastructure in Build countries—to \naccommodate their growing and urbanising \npopulations—represents an opportunity \nto leverage circular solutions for better \nenvironmental and social outcomes. \nUnchecked urbanisation and the resulting \nurban sprawl of informal settlements is \noften linked to poverty, contaminated water, \nbiodiversity loss, and more. Currently, almost \none-third of urban residents live in slum \nhouseholds. 34 \nTo achieve the above, the most impactful circular solutions \nacross the Food system and the Built environment are:\nBUILD COUNTRY PROFILE\nBuild countries consume 13% of the global \nmaterial footprint, while they account for almost \n50% of the population.\nCountries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia \nsuch as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan \nand the Philippines, and some small island states, \nfor example.\nMinimal contribution to the overshoot \nof planetary boundaries: these countries \ncontribute 20% of land use change, 30% of \nfreshwater use, 23% of phosphorus emissions to \nsoil and 11% of nitrogen emissions. \nKey development pathways: As these \ncountries generally struggle to meet basic needs \nfor healthcare and education, their primary \nobjective is to improve living standards.

Circular \neconomy is an upgraded operating system that \ncan help tackle the complex and intertwined \nchallenges humanity is facing, if approached well. \nBut to go from theory to action, we must zoom out \nand look at the big picture rather than working in \nsilos: the relationships between each part of the \nsystem must be mapped and new collaborations \nformed. No single department, business, industry, \ncity or nation should work in isolation—and \nno intervention should be applied without \nunderstanding its potential ripple effects. Systems \nthinking shows us the merit of targeting structures \nembedded in a system—such as regulatory \nframeworks and value systems—rather than \ntackling symptoms. In other words, we must tackle \nproblems’ root causes to create lasting change. \nThis Report takes this approach on a global scale. \nIt identifies the most impactful circular solutions \nfor industries across country profiles and shows \nhow legal, regulatory and financial incentives can \nbe shifted to unlock true structural change that \nbenefits people. \nSYSTEMIC CHANGE REQUIRES SYSTEMS \nTHINKING\nToday’s world can be characterised by the ‘polycrisis’: \nthe unfolding of multiple overlapping and interlinked \neconomic, environmental, social and political crises \nand challenges. As these converge, billions of people \naround the globe are impacted on a day-to-day basis. \nTechnology and innovation are often cited as the \nsolutions to climate and environmental challenges. \nWhile necessary, they in and of themselves cannot \ntackle the multidimensional challenges of ecological \nbreakdown. This is partly because of rebound effects \nstemming from efficiency gains that actually increase \ntotal material use, 35 but also because they are typically \none-dimensional and reactive, solving a specific issue \nbut failing to adapt the incentive structures required to \ninfluence entire systems. The challenge of the century \nwill be to tackle these crises in an integrated manner: \na systems-thinking approach can tackle complexity, \ndeal with uncertainty, balance trade-offs, limit rebound \neffects and prevent embedding biases that can cause \nissues down the line. \nSystems thinking must inform how we roll \nout circular economy solutions. This involves \nidentifying root causes, key leverage points and \nsystemic enablers, thereby shifting incentives:\n1. Uncover root causes. We have to tackle the \nproblem itself, not the symptom. Bringing \nhuman activity back within a safe operating \nspace will require us to address the root causes \nof ecological breakdown—namely excessive \nmaterial use, which has been supercharged \nby consumerism, the quantity of waste and \npollution released, and the damage dealt to the \nplanet’s ecosystems.\n2. Identify leverage points. These are spots \nin a system—be it a business, economy, city \nor ecosystem—where one small shift can \ntrigger transformative change. 36 By using \ncircular solutions to fine-tune the structures \ninfluencing our perceptions, motivations and \nbehaviour, we can spur true systems change.\n3. Determine systemic enablers.  Systems \nchange won’t happen without political and \nfinancial backing—nor without the support \nof the workforce. Here, active government \nsupport for deep transformation will play a key \nrole by changing ‘the rules of the game’ and \n‘levelling the playing field’ to enable equitable \ncircular solutions.\nUltimately, shifting incentives.  Bringing the three \npoints above together can help us shift incentives \nand encourage actors to rethink how materials, \nfinance, knowledge and skills flow through their \neconomies. By doing so, we can accelerate \nprogress towards a global circular economy \nthat improves wellbeing without overshooting \nplanetary boundaries. Shifting incentives is crucial \nto changing behaviour and ultimately preventing \nmaterial use from spiralling further. \n34\n35\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024",

      "content": "POLICY, FINANCE AND \nPEOPLE\nSuccessful systemic change hinges on support \nfrom governments, financial actors, businesses and \ncitizens alike: connecting policies and laws, capital \nand business models and people will be crucial to the \ncircular transition. \nPolicy encompasses the rules, guidelines and laws  \nset by governments that have the power to shape  \nthe actions of citizens, businesses and whole \neconomies alike. Policies and legal frameworks  \n‘set the rules of the game’, and can incentivise  \nsustainable and circular practices while penalising \nharmful ones, thereby shaping the nature and scale \nof economic activities across industries and nations. \nIn many cases, however, enforcing legislation  \nremains a challenge: monitoring and penalties  \nmust be strict enough that individuals and  \nbusinesses play by the rules.\nFinance is the lifeblood of the economy. Financial \nflows—managed by powerful financial institutions—\ndetermine which ideas are realised, and which \nactivities and businesses are funded and scaled. \nFinancing is necessary for circular solutions to replace \nlinear practices, and should particularly be directed \nat activities that bring about positive impact, such \nas cuts to virgin material use and the provision of \ndecent work. Furthermore, addressing key systemic \nlevers—such as the uptake of consistent circular \nassessment metrics, environmental fiscal reform, \ntrue-cost accounting, alleviating the debt burden and \ntransforming multilateral financing institutions—will \nbenefit all.\nPeople are key agents and beneficiaries of change: \ntheir skills, jobs, awareness and choices can help to \nachieve systemic change and will be impacted by \nactions taken. Many things—such as policy, finance, \neducation, migration, and the current state of the \neconomy—influence people’s livelihoods and the \nlabour market. These factors impact how people’s \nskills are used, and how income and opportunities \nare distributed across and within societies. Aligning \nlaws, flows of capital and opportunities for people \nwith circular economy principles creates a powerful \nsynergy, ultimately allowing us to shift away from our \ntake-make-waste mode of operation in a way that \nworks with and for people. \nCONNECTING THE DOTS TO UNLOCK \nSYSTEMIC CHANGE\nAlthough public policy has the power to shift priorities \nand ultimately redefine the ‘rules of the game’, so that \nthey facilitate—rather than restrict—the transition, the \nincreasingly financialised economic system 37 has limited \ngovernment's ability to enact change, allocate funds and \ndirect spending to necessary capital-intensive green \ninvestment—from green infrastructure development \nto welfare schemes, particularly in Build and Grow \ncountries. 38 In this system, countries’ GDP and national \nwealth (and debt) can rise, while environmental stability \nand human wellbeing erode. \nTo maximise the environmental, social and economic \npotential of the circular economy, governments must \nactively support mission-driven innovation, redesign \nmarkets to maximise public value creation, align on \npurpose-driven strategies and reduce inequality to \nuphold social cohesion. While there has been a rise \nin circular economy-related policymaking, 39 more \nconcerted efforts are needed from governments to \nredefine the goal of the economy and put powerful \nincentives in place that can truly foster systemic \nchange. This fundamental role of capital in the circular \ntransition especially highlights the importance of public \nfinance. In many countries, significant targeted public \ninvestment remains the crucial first step to developing \nthe capacity, infrastructure and know-how to implement \ncircular economy solutions at scale. Entrepreneurial \nstates and development banks 40 are best suited to take \non this task, ensuring ‘value’ is redefined to go beyond \nfinance and also consider returns in natural, social and \nhuman capital.\nInternational financial institutions and governments \nalso have an important role in mainstreaming circular \nmodels, and incentivising private finance to engage with \nprojects and businesses that minimise resource demand \nand that actively keep materials in use for as long as \npossible. One of the main problems with the existing \neconomic paradigm, however, is that the economics \njust don’t work for making the global economy \noperate within planetary boundaries: environmental \nand social harms (so-called ‘negative externalities’) \nare not factored into prices, and this heavily favours \ninvestments in the linear businesses that extract \nand pollute as means to keep costs down and profits \nup. While this is a pricing issue, it stems from policy \ndecisions. Finance and policy  must work in tandem \nto level this playing field for circular solutions. Policy \nmust set the right incentives in place to channel private \ncapital towards desired activities, so that finance can \npractically enable and accelerate the transition.* \nLast but certainly not least, the labour market  is a \npivotal lever for driving the circular economy transition \nby harnessing a country's national competencies, \nknowledge and skills. To maximise this, circular \nprinciples can be integrated into education, strategies \nfor workforce development, and forecasting within \nthe labour market: the circular economy will be labour \nintensive, especially in certain sectors, and it will \nrequire re- and up-skilling huge numbers of people. \nThis comprehensive approach can ensure a synergistic \nrelationship between the circular economy and the \nlabour market, fostering sustainable and decent \nlivelihoods. \nTo bring circular interventions to life around the world, \nit will be key to uncover the people, skills and roles \npivotal for success, while crucially accounting for \natypical forms of work—temporary, flexible or informal \nwork, for example—and considering the interplay of \nsocial equity and gender dynamics that impact decent \nwork outcomes. If the circular transition is managed \nequitably and effectively, it can positively impact the \nlabour market by providing new job opportunities, \nraising job standards and reducing inequalities through \na global redistribution of value and opportunities. To \neffectively transition to a circular economy, however, \nit's crucial to better understand the trade-offs and \ndynamics inherent in the labour market to help craft \nstrategies that manage or mitigate challenges that \nmight crop up during the transition. For example, \nby addressing inevitable job losses in transitioning \nindustries or shifting trade relationships. \nPUTTING POLICY, FINANCE AND PEOPLE TO \nWORK ACROSS COUNTRY PROFILES\nUnlocking and realising circular economy solutions \nwill require systemic enablers that can overcome \nchallenges specific to different country profiles and \nsystems. It’s important to recognise that the three \nenablers of policy, finance and people are not isolated \nfrom each other—they are deeply intertwined. Each \nfaces its own barriers in each country profile, and in \neach system. For example, while Shift  countries enjoy \navailable capital and space to develop cutting-edge \npolicies, many Build  and some Grow  countries are \nbound by less access to financial resources, a huge \ndebt burden 41 and a lack of autonomous policy space. \nFor this reason, a different mix of enablers across \npolicy, finance and society will be needed to kickstart \naction in each country profile and system.\n* Ultimately, the goal will be to redefine the regulatory and fiscal \nframework to ensure that circular investments become the first-best \nsolutions for private investors, based on their risk-return credentials. This \nwill involve reduced interest rates for sustainable activities to develop \nlocal markets and lower the risks for private finance to engage.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT\nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n37\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n36\n",

It is estimated that if \nevery person were to live and consume like the US, \nfor example, we would need five Earths to sustain \nour population. 43 At the same time, despite the \nrelatively comfortable lifestyles enjoyed, Shift \ncountries have failed to eliminate social shortfalls \nin many ways. For example, the gap between rich \nand poor is only widening: 44 in Organisation for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \ncountries, (a group almost exclusively composed of \nShift nations) income inequality is the highest it’s \nbeen for the past half a century. 45 This trend has \naccelerated as the cost of living crisis continues. 46\nWhile these countries have stricter domestic \nenvironmental regulations and advanced waste \nmanagement systems, they drive significant \nenvironmental degradation in the rest of the world. 47 \nDemand from Shift  countries sparks extraction and \npollution elsewhere—and these wealthy nations \noutsource industrial production to countries with \nweaker environmental and social regulations.

      "content": "SYST EM ONE: B UILD \nA CIRCULA R BUILT \nENVIRONMEN T\nWhat could a circular built environment look like in \nShift countries?\nShift  countries have already built up much of their \nbuildings and infrastructure: so here, circular solutions \ncentre on making the most of what already exists. In \na circular future, buildings are repurposed, renovated \nand retrofitted rather than demolished, meaning that \nfar fewer materials are used to provide housing or \ncommercial spaces. Through adaptive reuse principles, \nabandoned buildings are given new life, and heritage \nsites are carefully preserved through structural \nupgrades, for example. \nAll of these processes make use of the most circular \nmaterials possible: locally-sourced, renewable and \nsecondary. Where building new is necessary, circular \ndesign strategies are the gold standard—from material \nlightweighting to biomimicry. Nature’s inspirational \nsolutions are used to influence building design and \neven act as a muse for material innovation: cutting-\nedge innovations like bendable concrete—inspired by \nthe chemical structure of abalone shells—are used \nto cut material use while maintaining strength and \ndurability, for example. 50 Buildings are designed for \nrepairability and deconstruction, so that components \nand materials can be easily reused in the future, and \nwith a focus on energy efficiency. These low-carbon \nbuildings of the future are also seamlessly connected \nto renewable energy sources. Circular construction is \nthe norm thanks to heavy public support, with policies, \nincentives and fiscal mechanisms making sustainability \nworth developers’ while. \nBuilt environment workers in Shift  countries benefit \nfrom circularity, too: workers have been well-prepared \nfor the change in job profiles, with harmonised training \nsystems across the EU, for example, equipping workers \nwith the necessary skills for success: 51 think Building \nInformation Management (BIM) systems and 3D \nprinting, for example. Decent working conditions are \na reality for all, including migrant workers, who have \npreviously been at higher risk for workplace injuries \nand are more likely to be employed under short-\nterm contracts. With labour shortages already rife \nin construction industries in Shift  countries, circular \neconomy interventions need to include measures that \nincrease the quality and attractiveness of these roles.\nWhat could a circular built environment look like in \nShift countries?\nWe envision a circular future for the built environment in \nShift  countries, in which design, construction, operation \nand end-of-use management work in synergy to deliver \nhighly resource efficient buildings and infrastructure in a \nfully closed-loop system. Unlocking this vision, however, \nwill require concerted action across policy, finance, \nand the labour market. Some of the key components of \nunlocking this vision include the following:\nReward market players for investing in circular \nsolutions and business models\nMany actors in the built environment aim to adopt \ncircular business models but lack the regulatory signals \nand economic incentives to do so. A policy environment \nthat carefully mixes regulations and rewards for market \nplayers is key to (dis)incentivising innovation in business \npractices across the entire built environment value \nchain. \n• Implement strict regulations that prioritise \nrenovation, retrofitting and adaptive reuse \nwherever possible, and require the high-value \nrecycling and reuse of construction and demolition \nwaste. This could include mandating adaptive reuse \nand renovation for existing structures, rolling out \npenalties for landfilled or incinerated waste and \napplying minimum requirements for secondary \nmaterial reuse in renovation and lifetime extension \nprojects. This would interrupt the cycle of demolishing \nand building new, which is a key barrier to maximising \nthe value of what already exists for as long as \npossible.\n• Develop effective certifications and warranties \nfor secondary materials  to validate their safety \nand quality, and make it much easier for contractors \nto comply with building regulations when using \nthese materials. This effort could be combined with \nstrengthened environmental requirements for \nimported materials to mitigate the use of high-impact \nvirgin materials that have been produced in locations \nwith less stringent standards. These efforts in tandem \ncan help incentivise builders and developers to make \nmore sustainable material choices. 52 The skills and \nknowledge needed to adhere to these certifications \nmust be integrated into Vocational Education and \nTraining (VET) and in-work training.\n• Roll out standards and criteria for circularity  \nthroughout public procurement, zoning and spatial \nplanning guidelines. Bold targets can be set to \ndecrease buildings’ and infrastructure’s embodied \ncarbon, next to mandating material passports and \ntargets for secondary or bio-based material use. \nNormalising circular economy practices throughout \nbuilding regulations creates demand in the market \nfor companies to invest in and compete on circular \neconomy approaches.\n• Roll out innovative land ownership models, such \nas Community Land Trusts, to ensure affordable \nlong-term housing for communities—homes should \nnot be treated like a financial asset first, and a \nplace to live second. 53 Regulatory, technical and \nfinancial instruments like the restriction of foreign \ninvestment in housing can be tailored so that \nbuildings are used more appropriately. Improved \naccess to financing for cooperative housing, or the \nright to first refusal can ensure that buildings are \nused efficiently. 54\nMake circular building projects an attractive \ninvestment option\nWorking in synergy with the stricter policy \nenvironment that is described above, it is crucial to \nexpand the flow of capital and investment toward \ncompanies who take the risks to transition toward \nmore circular models. The barrier of risk aversion must \nbe fully overcome in order to transition the sector to a \nmore circular model.\n• Financially incentivise circular construction  \nby cutting property taxes for buildings that meet \ncircular criteria, providing tax credits for circular \nmaterial use or reducing insurance premiums for \ncircular buildings or infrastructure. Additional \nfinancial support can be provided through \nsubsidies and grants that encourage the application \nof circular business models, or experimental \nmaterials and building techniques. Mission-driven \nfinancial mechanisms such as green bonds or \nsustainability-linked low-interest loans can make \ncircular initiatives more financially attractive for \nlarge developers.\n• Establish a common language amongst \nstakeholders in the financial and building \nsectors  to boost transparency and enable better \ncollaboration. This is already taking place in the \nEU. For example, the EU Taxonomy, Corporate \nSustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), \nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) \nand labelling of circular built environment projects \nthrough initiatives such as Level(s) are all important \nsteps in this direction. This is because they \nconsolidate the assessment and reporting of the \nsustainable performance of construction activities \nand buildings across their entire lifecycle.\n• Rethink accounting standards and practices  \nto better capture the value of built assets, frame \nwaste as a resource so that no building depreciates \nalong a linear pathway, and acknowledge the \npositive benefits of long-term social, environmental \nand economic impacts for investment. This could \nalso include the revision of building regulations \nto accurately reflect the depreciation of various \nbuilding components. Buildings don’t depreciate \nas a whole—some parts wear out faster than \nothers: furniture and facades, for example, have \nmuch shorter useful lives than building structures. \nAccurately capture this difference to boost the long-\nterm value of building projects. 55\nClose the labour and skills gap with a mix of \neducation and policy \nDespite having a highly skilled workforce, critical \nknowledge and skills gaps persist in the building sector. \nThis must be tackled to deliver circular solutions at \nscale. This presents a number of opportunities, such \nas bringing more women into the workforce, training \nmigrant workers, and increasing workers’ safety—all of \nwhich remain challenges in this sector today.\n•   Address labour shortages in the industry by \naligning policy and increasing the attractiveness \nof jobs.

Such an approach \nwould address local shortages of workers and \nprovide greater mobility to workers who can bring \nthe necessary skills that deliver circular approaches \nwithin the construction sector through tools like \nskills passports. 56\nHAFENCITY, A FORMER INDUSTRIAL \nBROWNFIELD SITE TURNED \nINCLUSIVE ‘CITY-WITHIN-A-CITY’ \nIS A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE \nDEVELOPMENT. \nLike many European cities, Hamburg faces \nchallenges tied to rapid urban growth, \ndensity and lack of affordable housing. \nGentrification has led to increased rents, \nrising inequalities and the displacement of \nlong-time residents. In an effort to combat \nthe increasing demand for housing and \noffices while anticipating flood risks, the city \ndecided to redevelop its former port into a \nnew urban district: HafenCity.\nIn the early 2000s, the City of Hamburg \nlaunched one of the biggest inner-city \nregeneration projects yet.  The objective \nwas to extend Hamburg’s downtown area by \n40%, create inner-city access to the shores of \nthe Elbe and provide additional housing for \nthe city’s growing population. 57 The process \nfollowed the concept of urban regeneration , \nwhich connects the stimulation of economic \nactivities and environmental improvements \nwith wider social and cultural aspects. 58 \nWhile several urban regeneration projects \nhave made ground in the EU over the last \nfew years, HafenCity’s scale and ambition \nset it apart. HafenCity is built on a former \nindustrial port area and effectively reuses \nexisting infrastructure and land.  Its \nhistoric warehouses have been preserved \nand converted into mixed-use spaces, such \nas offices, restaurants and apartments, \nextending the life of these structures. What’s \nmore, the City of Hamburg negotiated \ncomplete site control from the start, \nwhich allowed it to counter conventional \npractices concerning building designs \nand technologies, land use synergies and \nenvironmental amenities and performance. \nTo achieve such high environmental and \nsocial objectives, HafenCity relied on a \nspecific public-private governance model, \nHafenCityHamburg GmbH . A GmbH, or \n‘Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung ’ is a \nlimited liability company. The partnership \ncombines the efficiency of the private \nsector (market discipline and mechanisms) \nwith the benefits of public direction and \nlegitimacy. 59 This entailed a clear division \nof responsibilities between public owners \nand private managers to avoid short-term \npartisan politics. The city developed \nambitious tendering processes that \nfavoured quality over price.  HafenCity \nHamburg GmbH drives development \nconcepts that support a socially balanced \nmix of apartments—one-third of which \nare reserved for low and medium-income \nhouseholds—good architecture, urban \ndesign and energy efficiency. \nIn terms of mobility, the city prioritises \nsmart solutions with walking, cycling and \npublic transport, substantially reducing \ncar ownership.  To further reduce reliance \non fossil fuels, the city relies on green \nheating power for high energy efficiency, \nreduced CO 2 emissions and lower energy \nbills. All the buildings in HafenCity must be \nconnected to two district heating networks, \nfor example. Compared to a conventional \nfossil fuel heat supply, by 2028, a minimum of \n75,000 tonnes of CO 2 will be saved. For each \nsubsequent year, an additional 12,000 tonnes \nwill be saved.\nIf that wasn’t enough, the city also \ndeveloped Germany’s first cradle-to-\ncradle design residential project, the \nMoringa project. 60 It is the healthiest high-\nrise building to ever have been constructed \nin Germany, with half the materials used \ncoming from secondary sources and \nboasting maximal green space. Hamburg \nembeds sustainable design throughout \nthe city, requiring all renovation and \nnew building projects to have eco-labels \ncertifying environmental sustainability \nin construction.  The DNG special aware \nlabel, launched in 2022, is focused on \ncircular construction methods: the use of \nregenerative raw materials such as timber \nand clay, carbon-reduced steel, recycled \nbuilding materials and modular or reduced-\nconcrete construction methods. It also places \nan important focus on the documentation \nof the materials used and their separability \nduring deconstruction to favour their \nrecycling and reuse potential. 61\nThe project is set to be completed by 2030, \nat which time HafenCity will house 15,000 \nresidents, 5,000 students and create up to \n45,000 jobs. HafenCity is a model for other \ncities implementing circular and socially \nsustainable development concepts. The \nsetup of HafenCity Hamburg GmbH as an \nautonomous subsidiary helped to avoid \ncumbersome and lengthy planning processes \nand red tape. The ambitious tendering \nprocess has allowed both the city and its \nstakeholders to achieve their objectives, \ncreating a diversified urban and social \nfabric while upholding strong standards for \nreusing what existed by applying eco-design \nprinciples. \nCircular, socially sustainable \npublic procurement holds \nstrong potential for setting \nhigh standards and driving \nchange. We can source \ngreener, more sustainable \nproducts and services while \nsupporting local employment, \nin fair and decent conditions.\nJuliette Moizo, French Ministry of \nEnvironment\n43\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n42\n",

Here, consumption is guided \nby an appreciation for nature and its resources, with \nconsumerism a thing of the past. Schools pass this \nethos on to younger generations, who are taught to \ncare for and repair their belongings from primary \neducation, while advertising extols the charm of the \nwell-used over the allure of the new. Consuming less \nbut cherishing more, Shift societies enjoy lifestyles \nmarked by quality and connection rather than quantity \nand consumption.\nConsumer goods are made to last, too: fast fashion \nis replaced by durable, easy-to-mend and recyclable \nclothing, while electronics are designed for \nrepairability and upgradability, with robust ‘right to \nrepair’ laws ensuring access to parts and services. \nBusinesses play a positive role in society by offering \nservices like repair, rental and second-hand sales, \nwith take-back schemes making it simple to give their \nproducts a second life. Instead of tossing their items at \nend-of-use, citizens also swap, share or upcycle their \nclothing, electronics, furniture and appliances. This \nis all backed by supportive government policies and \ncommunity-based initiatives—such as clothing banks, \ntool ‘libraries’ and repair cafés—that make circular \nbehaviour as convenient as possible. \nIn this circular future, workers in the manufacturing \nsector have been well prepared for changes in their \njob profiles, and are increasingly trained in upgrading, \nrepairing, refurbishing and remanufacturing products, \nas well as how to market and sell services as well \nas products. Jobs in recycling, reverse logistics and \nsecondary markets have also risen, as well as good \nquality jobs in service sectors.\nHow can we unlock this vision in Shift  countries?\nShift  countries need to scale down socially unnecessary \nproduction and consumption and focus on activities \nthat uphold wellbeing. Curbing overconsumption will \nrequire a comprehensive mix of policy instruments \nto inspire action, reduce existing barriers and shift \nmindsets. The keys to unlocking this vision include, but \nare not limited to:\nEncourage products to be designed for \ncircularity: durable, and easy to reuse, repair \nand recycle \nConstructing an ecosystem of complementary \nand supporting regulations is crucial to the wide \nscale adoption of circular business models and to \nencourage the uptake of new ownership models, \nsuch as Product-as-a-Service and Peer-to-Peer \nproduct-sharing platforms. 62 \n• Strengthen universal Right to Repair \nlegislation and Extended Producer \nResponsibility, 63 which require manufacturers \nto provide spare parts, tools and repair manuals \nto their customers and repair shops. Ensure \nlegislation puts repair before replacement, \nprovides data for the open-source production \nof spare parts and removes software barriers to \nrepair.64\n• Set standards for material efficiency and \nproduct durability,  especially for electronics \nand appliances. Prohibit planned obsolescence \nand incentivise repair, recycling and reuse \nto extend product lifetimes. This could also \nbe extended to include setting targets for \nmaterial use reduction  that progressively \nand rapidly decline until sustainable levels are \nreached at the needed speed, scope and scale, \nand banning the destruction of unsold or \nreturned goods , banning waste exports and \nintroducing liability for waste export violations \nto lessen waste generation. Require regular \nmaintenance for goods —such as capital \nequipment—to ensure value is retained for  \nas long as possible.\nUse pricing and convenience to nudge people \ntoward sufficiency lifestyles\nPricing and convenience help people make better \nchoices. Making circular products and services more \naffordable and cost-effective is crucial to encourage \nconsumers to adopt less materialistic lifestyles and \nmore sustainable consumption patterns, making \nthe transition to a sufficiency-centred lifestyle both \nfeasible and attractive.\n• Stimulate demand-oriented shifts  that \nencourage lifestyle changes and reduce barriers \nto repairing, refurbishing, remanufacturing and \nrecycling products, both for consumers and \nindustries. This could include developing an \nenvironmental ‘score’ for all products to be \nincluded on labels,  and banning the advertising \nof high-impact goods and services,  from fast \nfashion to air travel. This could be realised in a \nvariety of ways such as restricting advertising \nin public places and to children or establishing \ncommercial-free zones and times. \n• Apply more progressive taxation and heavier \ninheritance and wealth taxes  to curb excessive \nwealth and income inequality and reduce the \noverconsumption of luxury goods. 65\n• Provide consumers with financial incentives \nsuch as bonus cheques, or reduced or zero tax on \nrepair services and refurbished goods, that allow \nthem to easily repair their goods or shop second-\nhand.66 These incentives could be quite targeted \ntowards specific consumer goods like fast-fashion \nand electronics. \n• Governments may also consider taxing \nmaterial extraction rather than labour. 67  \nThis would require broad stakeholder  \nengagement between actors in academia,  \nthe private sector and financial institutions to \nsupport research and scale pilot projects that \nadvance ‘true cost’ pricing. 68\nFoster a cultural shift where sustainability is \nthe norm and sufficiency mindsets prevail\nUltimately, the entrenchment of consumerism \nand linear production-consumption patterns \nin contemporary culture and social norms \nunderscores the necessity of a paradigm shift, \nwhere values, attitudes and behaviours are \nrealigned to embrace circularity and sufficiency.\n• Invest in and use just transition funds to \ninvest in skills development, education and \ntraining. 69 In particular, support regions with \nhistorically extraction-focused economies in \n(re)training their workers and youth to prepare \nthem for a circular future. Public education \nshould also be shaped so that necessary skills, \nknowledge, and problem-solving abilities are \nembedded in all forms of education. This will \nserve to influence both career choices and \nconsumer behaviour.\n• Roll out Job Guarantees and explore reducing \nthe standard work week to gradually break \nthe ‘work and spend’ cycle and foster a less \nmaterialistic, more relational and participatory \nsociety. Promote Job Guarantee programmes as \na way of increasing green jobs while reducing \nunemployment, poverty and income inequality. 70, \n71 Support social dialogue as a way of improving \nworkers’ rights and acquiring better and safe \nworking conditions within green sectors. 72 \n• Roll out awareness-raising campaigns to \novercome cultural barriers  to a more circular \nlifestyle. Encourage the practical realisation of \nsuch lifestyles by funding awareness campaigns, \nresponsible advertising and other interventions \nthat promote more sustainable choices and \nreduce stigma related to prolonging the life of or \nsharing consumer goods.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD GETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT BUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n45\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n44\n",

True fiscal integrity \nmeans breaking taboos; let's \nshape a system where the cost \nof new goods is transparent, and \nrepair is more appealing than \nreplacing, including through fiscal \nincentives.\nCristina Ganapini, The Restart Project\nPOLICY—SUCH AS THE \nEU’S RIGHT TO REPAIR \nLEGISLATION—CAN BE \nLEVERAGED TO MAKE REPAIR \nTHE NEW NORMAL. \nThe current status quo: products \nthat are made to break and are not \neasily repairable. Now, it’s difficult for \nconsumers to do anything other than \ntrading their broken goods for brand \nnew ones: repair processes are costly \nand complex, and the artificially low \nprices of new products make them the \nmore financially attractive option. This \nproduces mountains of waste: electronic \nwaste (e-waste), for example, is the EU’s \nfastest-growing waste stream—and less \nthan 40% of it is currently recycled. 73 On \na global scale, emissions from e-waste \ngrew by more than 50% between \n2014 and 2020—a figure expected to \nswell to new heights without targeted \nintervention. 74 \nThe EU, however, is tackling this, with \nconsiderable progress over the last \ndecade. Due to active lobbying efforts \nfrom advocacy groups and EU Member \nStates themselves, Right to Repair \nlegislation is emerging: the current \nProposal for a directive on common \nrules promoting the repair of goods, \nfor example, as well as amendments \nto other regulations and directives 75, 76, \n77 that prioritise repair as a remedy \nfor non-conforming products,  so long \nas it’s more affordable than product \nreplacement. The Proposal aims to \nfacilitate this by ensuring consumers \nare up-to-date on producers’ repair \nobligations, setting up online repair \nplatforms for nations to matchmake \nconsumers with retailers and repair \nservices, and determining a European-\nwide quality standard for repairs.  \nIt’s expected that repair will become \nincreasingly easy and attractive for \nconsumers, resulting in cost savings of \naround €176.5 billion over 15 years—\nor around €25 per person per year. 78 \nSocial gains are also expected for EU \nrepair businesses: sales for the sector \nwill largely apply to small- and medium-\nsized enterprises and social enterprises, \ngenerating quality jobs across the \nregion.79 Environmental impacts are \nalso expected to be significant, with \nthe Proposal expected to save 18.4 \nmillion tonnes of CO 2 over 15 years —\nequivalent to the emissions generated \nby a year’s worth of energy use for 2.1 \nmillion homes. While the Proposal has \nyet to be approved, its impact could be \nfavourable—despite concerns relating \nto software barriers, the scope of the \nlegal guarantee and the affordability of \nspare parts, considerations currently not \naddressed in the directive’s text.\nIndividual Member States are already \ntaking this a step further, rolling out a \nrange of policy tools to make repair the \nnew normal: Sweden, for example, has \ncut VAT rates for repair, while Austria, \nGermany and France now offer repair \nbonuses—partial reimbursement \nfor consumers that take this route. \nIn Graz, Austria, both commercial \nand community repair initiatives are \nsupported, with Repair Cafés eligible \nfor yearly funding, while repair bonus \nfunding in Upper Austria saved around \n260 tonnes of e-waste between \nSeptember and December 2019 alone. 80 \nFrance has also rolled out a repairability \nindex for five categories of electronic \ndevices, 81 informing consumers on their \noptions prior to purchase. A mix of both \nhard regulatory tools—such as those \ntargeting manufacturers—and softer \ninstruments that tackle cultural barriers \nand shift consumer attitudes is proving \nremarkably effective: a range of policies \nare needed to promote repair as the way \nforward.\n47\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n46\n",

Where fast food, unhealthy diets and \nfood waste were once rising, these countries could \nchampion regenerative agriculture centred on people \nand the planet.\nIn this new system, fields are no longer vast \nmonocultures but rather host diverse polycultures \nthat nurture soil, maintain local biodiversity, and yield \nabundant local and seasonal foods. Industrial farms \nhave adopted regenerative practices, and ecosystems \nare regenerated at scale. Protein production has \nbeen reimagined at scale, providing a greater range \nof plant-based options and greatly reducing the \nlevel of industrially reared livestock. This has had a \ntremendously positive impact on the environment, \nclimate and public health. Meanwhile, the workforce \nhas been well-equipped with the relevant skills to \nsupport this transition. Beyond the fields, a network of \nlocal processing units and markets thrives. These hubs \nprioritise minimal processing, ensuring the nutritional \nvalue of food is retained while providing employment \nto many. These hubs also act as centres of innovation, \npioneering techniques to reduce food loss and \ntransform waste.\nWhat’s more, the narrative around consumption \nwould shift dramatically. Urban and rural communities \nsavour predominantly local, seasonal and organic \ndiets. Meals have become a celebration of regional \nflavours, supported by educational campaigns \nunderscoring their health benefits. The public health \nlandscape has been transformed. With diets rich in \ndiverse, organic and fresh ingredients, illnesses such \nas diabetes and obesity have drastically declined. \nMoreover, the emphasis on local and seasonal foods \nmeans that food loss, emissions and environmental \nimpacts are all far lower. In this vision of the future, \nthe circle of life is truly complete: the circular food \nsystem in Grow  countries nurtures nature, and nature, \nin turn, provides nourishment that holistically sustains \ncommunities. \nHow can we unlock this vision in Grow countries? \nWe imagine a resilient, climate-smart and nature-\npositive food system that nurtures Grow countries’ \ncommunities and ecosystems based on legislation that \nis integrated, tailored and aligned with other policies. 82 \nThe keys to unlocking this vision include, but are not \nlimited to:\nRoll out an integrated policy mix to encourage \nnutritious choices and cut food waste\nImplement an integrated policy mix to encourage \nsustainable food consumption based on nutritional \ncontent and environmental impact 83 and to prevent \nand valorise food loss and waste across all stages of \nproduction and consumption. 84, 85  Household income \ngrowth is often followed by rising consumption of \nhigh-impact foods and increased volumes of food loss \nand waste. Policy, finance and public communication \ntools can create structural incentives for consumers to \nchoose nutritious and low-impact options over the long \nterm, and minimise and valorise food loss and waste. \n• Roll out effective market-based incentives tailored \nto consumers that make healthy and sustainable \nfoods the preferred option. This could mean taxes on \nhigh-impact food products, within a broader redesign \nof taxation so that poverty and inequality are not \nexacerbated. Set mandatory public procurement \nstandards —for example, for local, organic, or more \nplant-based food and beverages—to facilitate market \naccess and create a stable market for these products, \nand trigger wider societal behavioural changes. \n• Create an effective regulatory environment, \nincluding advertising sales bans  on certain high-\nimpact food products that threaten human and \nplanetary health—especially ones directed at children \nor placed in public spaces such as hospitals. Make \nfood waste reporting compulsory and strengthen \nstakeholder cooperation to improve the tracking of \nfood losses across the value chain. This can include \nintroducing mandatory legal requirements \nfor strong food waste reduction targets and \nsupporting processes as high as possible in the food \nwaste hierarchy, such as prevention and reuse.\n• Use information-based incentives,  such as food \nlabels with information about food products' \nenvironmental and social impact. Strengthen \neducation and raise awareness with effective \npublic information campaigns to demonstrate \nthe benefits of sustainable agriculture, to subtly \nbut effectively shift conceptions around meat or \n'Western' diets as inspirational and high status \namong the population. Identify and communicate \nthe added value of prevention measures to \nvarious value chain actors.\nUse policy to ensure that financial institutions \ninvest in regenerative farming and circular food\nThe right investment tools and practices must \nbe developed to allow for broad investment in \nregenerative farming and circular food companies \nimplementing circular solutions across the agricultural \nvalue chain. Financial institutions are instrumental \nin driving the economic viability of different business \nmodels and can thus directly influence producers to \ndevelop responsible and transparent supply chains \nand prioritise investments in sustainable agricultural \ncompanies.\n• Policymakers can ensure that the financial \nregulatory environment supports  long-term \ntransformation by introducing transparency \nrequirements. This will help ensure that companies’ \nlobbying activities  comply with their public \nstatements, and contribute to fully traceable \nsupply chains  where companies are responsible \nfor upholding strict sustainability standards and \nhuman and labour rights across. These frameworks \ncan ensure that investors can’t capture short-term \ngains while escaping long-term costs by redirecting \ncapital from intensive, industrial practices (such as \nanimal farming) to more sustainable ones (such as \nalternative protein production).\n• Financial institutions can shift capital  toward \nregenerative agriculture, alternative protein and \nfood waste upcycling companies, while actively \nencouraging investee companies to adopt such \nmethods. They can also set clear processes  for \nportfolio assessment, monitoring and reporting \nto maintain transparency and accountability, and \nimplement robust monitoring systems to detect \nharmful practices such as deforestation and high \nmethane emissions. They can also divest  from \ncompanies with evidence of negative environmental \nor social impacts, while ensuring rigorous due \ndiligence  to differentiate genuine sustainable \npractices from greenwashing. 86\nRestructure economic incentives and regulations to \nprioritise regenerative farming models and holistic \nland management practices\nRegenerative farming remains a difficult model to bring \nto the mainstream due to, partly, a lack of alignment \naround the definitions and distorted economic \nsignals expressed by prices that don’t reflect the \ntrue environmental and social costs of mainstream \nagricultural practices. Designing agricultural policies in \nsupport of regenerative approaches and progressively \nshifting funds, pricing models and subsidies could \nstructurally change the playing field and drive \ntransformation. 87, 88 \n• Ensure a true price for sustainable food that \nfully reflects the social and environmental impacts \nso that products of regenerative and sustainable \nfarming are competitive and attractive. Aligning \nprice signals and shifting fiscal incentives away \nfrom heavily polluting practices could encourage \nfarmers to place longer-term investments in \nsustainable practices that are demonstrated to \nenhance soil health, reduce synthetic fertiliser \nand pesticide use, cut water use and enhance \nbiodiversity, for example. Direct subsidies \naway from industrial agriculture  and towards \nsupporting farmers’ incomes and sustainable \nsolutions, such as solar-powered irrigation, organic \nnutrients for soil and integrated pest-management \nsolutions.\n• Establish fact-based regulatory frameworks \ntailored to particular farming systems and regions \nto support the roll out of carefully implemented \nagroecological approaches and regenerative \npractices, such as increasing biomass cycling \nand the nutrient balance while promoting the \nbiodiversity of systems. 89 Governments can enable \nthese practices and ensure efficient approval \nprocesses, certifications, labels and accessible \nintellectual property  to secure farmers’ access and \ncontrol over natural and other productive resources. \nThis will also help them scale up technologies and \nreduce costs, making sustainable products such as \nalternative protein production more accessible.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT\n51\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n50\n",

Capacity-building, training \nand reskilling programmes will also be crucial \nto upskill and leverage existing regenerative \npractices.\nCOCOAACTION BRASIL USES \nREGENERATIVE FARMING TO \nEMPOWER SMALL-SCALE COCOA \nFARMERS AND POSITIVELY IMPACT \nCOCOA PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.\nWhile multinational corporations control \nmuch of the sale and profits of the world’s \nchocolate, the majority of the world’s cocoa \nbeans are grown on small farms in the Global \nSouth. When it comes to producing cocoa \nsustainably and ethically, farmers often \nlack the technical knowledge and resources \nto implement such practices. 90 This is the \ncase in Brazil—the sixth largest producer \nof cocoa on the planet—where upwards of \n95,000 growers produce cocoa. 91 To promote \nsustainability with a focus on the grower, \nCocoaAction Brasil, a comprehensive \npublic-private pre-competitive initiative,  \nlaunched in 2018.\nCocoaAction Brasil works with value chain \npartners to align and develop the cocoa \nchain and promote knowledge exchange \nand synergies with existing work, giving \nspecial attention to sustainability. The \ninitiative enables value chain partners to \ndo so in four key ways: 1) working with \nproducers  to increase yield and quality and \nimprove farm management; 2) working \nwith communities  to strengthen working \nconditions, youth and gendered work, \nand labour unions; 3) working with the \ngovernment  on reforestation, agroforestry \nand land conservation; and 4) working \nacross the value chain  to increase access \nto funding and land regulation, information \nmanagement and governance. \nIn working with policymakers, CocoaAction \nBrasil has supported the publication of the \nNormative Instructions of Pará and Rondônia  \n(two northern Brazilian states), which enable \nthe recovery of legal reserves through cocoa \ncultivation in agroforestry systems. It has \nfurther revised Ordinances in the Bahia \nand Espírito Santo states that regulate the \nmanagement of the cabruca cocoa cultivation \nsystem and reinforce its relevance to the \npreservation of the Atlantic Forest. It also \ncontributed to improving the Plano Safra \n(Crop Plan) 2021–2022 , based on submissions \nfrom stakeholders and advocacy with the \nMinistry of Economy. These measures \ngenerate socio-environmental benefits, \ngenerate income for families and \nstimulate biodiversity conservation.\nCocoaAction Brasil also worked to increase \nsmall growers’ access to credit between \n2017 and 2021 by 240% through multiple \ninitiatives. For one, it coordinated GT \nCrédito, a working group that specifically \naddresses credit in the cocoa chain, linked \nwith the Cocoa and Agroforestry Systems \nSectoral Chamber of the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. It \nobtained the inclusion of rural residents \nin the Pronaf Floresta  credit line and cocoa \ngrown in agroforestry systems in the Pronaf \nBioeconomia  credit line. Finally, in partnership \nwith the International Labour Organisation, \nCocoaAction Brasil involved more than 50 \nentities of the public and private sectors \nand civil society to produce the Cacau 2030 \nStrategic Guidelines , a set of guiding actions \nfor the sustainable development of cocoa \nproduction focused on decent labour and \nbetter living conditions.\nOne company that has directly benefited \nfrom CocoaAction Brasil’s initiatives is \nDengo Chocolates—a sustainable and \nethical chocolate company based in the \nBrazilian state of Bahia. Dengo encourages \norganic cocoa, regenerative agriculture and \nagroforestry with 100% of the brand's cocoa \ncoming from traditional agroforestry \nsystems  known as cabruca . For its chocolate \nproduction, the company only purchases \ncocoa from local producers,  and farmers \nreceive more for the product they deliver—\nwith Dengo paying a premium of up to 160% \nof the market value for high-quality cocoa \nbeans.92\nDengo has found success and made a \nmajor impact on local communities by \nconnecting small- and medium-scale \nfarmers who are interested in creating \na high-quality product,  thus establishing \na network of local farmers for the mass \nproduction of chocolate. The network \nfollows the cultivation process set out by \nDengo to achieve the best possible cocoa. \nThe company provides free technical \nconsultancy and access to knowledge  \nabout harvesting, fermenting and drying \ncocoa beans. Today, the network consists of \naround 200 families of farmers and a part \nof the company’s profits are shared with \nthese farmers.\nTo date, Dengo boasts 100% student \nattendance, while 38% of its in-network \nfarmers earn above the minimum living wage \nand 45% have access to credit. To further \nembed sustainability into its products, \n34% of Dengo's products are sold in bulk, \npackaging is just 7% plastic and entirely \nrecyclable. Some packaging is even made \nfrom cocoa-based paper using production \nby-products. By designing its products \nsustainably and tapping into traditional \ncabruca agroforestry methods, the company \nhas preserved 20 hectares of Brazilian \nforest. 93 \nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\nToday, more than ever, \nsocial dialogue should be \nintegral to our policy efforts \nto a just transition towards \nenvironmental sustainability \nand the circular economy.\nElisenda Estruch Puertas, \nInternational Labour Organization\n53\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n52\n",

Central to this vision is \nthe design phase of products, which prioritises their \nentire lifecycle and focuses on qualities like durability \nand modularity. This shift can open the door for \nmany skilled job opportunities, from design engineers \nspecialising in sustainable materials to technicians \ntrained in product repair and remanufacture, heralding \na resurgence of craftsmanship and localised industries. \nMeanwhile, domestic and international trade \nevolves to prioritise exchanging sustainable and \ncircular products, components and services. This \nreimagined trade ecosystem values transparency, \nensuring products crossing borders meet stringent \nsustainability and ethical labour standards. Ultimately, \njustice and equity lie at the heart of this transition. \nRecognising that the shift to circularity might present \nchallenges—especially for those in extractive \nindustries and waste management—policies and \nsupport systems have been put in place. \nIn this adjusted system, industrial clusters, hubs \nand parks are strategically localised to capitalise \non synergies between sectors. Raw materials are \nchosen for their quality and social and environmental \nfootprints, emphasising sustainable and recycled \ninputs. This focus can spur a renaissance in local \nindustries that recover, process and recycle materials, \nstrengthening regional supply chains and promoting \nfair trade practices. Instead of becoming victims of \nobsolescence, local manufacturers become invaluable \nnodes in a resilient, interdependent network. Along \nwith production, consumption in this new paradigm \nis about conscious choices. People embrace making \ntheir products last, leading to a greater demand for \nmaintenance and repair services. This will lengthen \nproduct lifetimes and increase demand for Vocational \nEducation and Training (VET), equipping individuals \nwith the skills needed for a circular economy. Through \nthese comprehensive measures, Grow  countries can \ncraft fair, prosperous, and sustainable futures.\nHow can we unlock this vision in Grow  countries? \nOur circular vision for manufacturing in Grow  countries \nwill require a comprehensive policy mix to decarbonise \nand make industrial processes more circular. 94 Policies \nshould manage both supply and demand, embracing \n'push' and 'pull' measures, complemented by emphasis \non knowledge flows and technology transfers. The keys \nto unlocking this vision include, but are not limited to:\nRemove barriers to scaling circular manufacturing \nwith clear and mandatory targets and aligned \nincentives\nMandatory environmental impact reduction targets \nand policy incentives that promote innovative circular \nproduction processes can ensure that systems are \noptimised to reduce total material demand and save \nenergy. Creating clear targets and aligning incentives \nfor producers can overcome one of the core barriers to \nsustainable manufacturing, which is the ease and cost-\neffectiveness for companies to pollute and not incur \ncost or liability.\n• Introduce policy measures —including technology \nor performance requirements —that impose \nand enforce public bans and limits on pollution. \nOr, develop legislation that mandates ambitious \nExtended Producer Responsibility schemes 95 \nor requires a minimum amount of recovered \nmaterials for all new production  to cut resource \ndepletion, waste generation and air pollution, while \nminimising rebound effects.\n• Create economic incentives via pull mechanisms,  \nby properly taxing material- and carbon-intensive \nproduction and trade, and rolling out subsidies \nto encourage energy-efficient production and \nappropriate pricing of common resources. 96 This will \nserve to promote material cycling, extend product \nlifetimes and improve material and value retention, \nsubstitution and efficiency.\n• Integrate clusters and eco-industrial parks, and \nhubs into national policy frameworks such as \ndevelopment plans and national industrial strategies \nto foster industrial symbiosis and decarbonisation, \nespecially in resource-intensive sectors like metals, \ncement, chemicals and paper. 97 \nEnsure policy alignment to support industrial \ntransitions\n This means, for example, ensuring environmental \nimpact reduction targets (alongside others) are \nsupported by labour and education policies that can \ncreate demand for the occupations and skills needed \nto deliver on these goals.\n• Take an ambitious, mission-oriented approach to \nindustrial policy  that directs investments towards \nmaximising public-value creation and people’s \nwellbeing within ecological limits. 98 To this end, \ngovernments can directly invest in developing \nand adopting advanced technology  via subsidies \nand direct investment support schemes, such as \ninvestment funds  and public or private grants , \nto boost research and development into alternative \nmaterials to reduce upfront costs and risks. \n• Scale eco-industrial parks  via public-private \npartnerships with centralised management to \neffectively plan and coordinate services, including \nthe maintenance of a data system that can optimise \nresource-use and pollution control systems. Invest \nin common infrastructure,  such as district steam, \nwater management, heat neatworks, and energy, \ntransport and digital facilities to enable high-\nvalue industrial symbiosis that minimises waste \ngeneration and pollution. Promote collaboration \nbetween local academia and research \ninstitutions and companies  to deliver the \nnecessary technologies and innovation to meet the \ndesired outcomes of an inclusive circular economy \ntransition in the manufacturing sector. \nDirect significant capital investments and promote \ntechnology transfers to increase access to and \nhelp scale up innovative green and clean tech that \ndelivers cost savings, drives down material demand \nand reduces pollution\nA range of barriers severely constrain the ability of \nGrow countries to access and disseminate affordable \ntechnologies that are essential for environmental \nand climate objectives, such as: high costs related to \nlicensing fees and technology prices, limited access \ndue to overly protective patent restrictions and \nmonopolistic business dynamics, and innovation \nbarriers preventing knowledge sharing.\n• Develop policies to overcome barriers to access \nand facilitate the transfer of cleaner technology. For \ninstance, waivers to Intellectual Property Rights \ncan be introduced to improve access to technology \nthat helps facilitate deep electrification and \nleapfrogging to circular industrial activities, such \nas green hydrogen. This is particularly relevant for \nhard-to-abate industries such as steel and cement \nproduction. Shift countries can, via multilateral \nagreements, legislate, regulate, incentivise and \ncompel multilateral corporations  to enter into \nagreements with companies or governments to \nrevise intellectual property laws to introduce more \nflexibility and thus enable the rapid deployment of \ntechnologies that Grow  countries need, but currently \ncan’t access.\n• Ensure investments integrate social \nrequirements made on the basis of sound \nsocioeconomic indicators, to ensure socioeconomic \nbenefits are promoted and externalities are \nmitigated or prevented where possible. This \nshould include a strong focus on decent work and \noccupational health and safety, where existing \ncircular economy activities in these countries involve \nprecious and unsafe work. Where investments and \nsupport policies work to leverage or scale these \nexisting practices, it heightens the need to address \nworking conditions and the social protection system \nneeded to support working particularly in growing \nand emerging industries.\nBUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\nDevelop a forward-looking plan on sustainable \nskills development for the jobs of tomorrow\nGrow countries must navigate a rapidly changing \nlandscape of technological development throughout \nthe manufacturing sector. A significant factor for \nsuccess will be to properly educate and train people \nto master the skills for the economy of tomorrow. \nThis must be done in a holistic way to ensure that \nvulnerable groups are included in this transition  \nand society as a whole can benefit from decent  \nwork opportunities.\n• Invest in skills development programmes \nwith particular focus on workers vulnerable \nto the transition.

To \nalleviate the negative environmental \nimpacts of its manufacturing sector, \nChina has adopted the concept of an \n‘ecological civilisation’—a system of \ndevelopment and governance based \non the principles of environmental \nmanagement, ecological restoration and \ngreen development. 100\nChina's ‘ ecological civilisation ’ \nconsists of a set of initiatives based on \nenhanced sustainable production and \nconsumption, superior environmental \nand ecological planning for both urban \nand rural regions, and an industrial \necology that champions a comprehensive \ncircular economy with a zero-waste \napproach.101 Within this context, China \ninitiated its eco-industrial parks (EIPs) \nprogramme in 2001. EIPs are strategically \ndesigned as a blueprint for industrial \nclustering and transformation based \non clean production mandates, and \ncircular economy and industrial ecology \nprinciples. By 2021, the number of \nestablished EIPs had reached 55, up from \njust one in 2008, while another 52 are \nnow underway. 102\nChina has been successful in \ntransforming its industrial sector due \nin large part to three major factors: \ngovernmental frameworks and \ntechnical guidance, manufacturing \nprowess and strategic blueprints, \nand local governance and academic \nsynergy.  In terms of governmental \nframeworks and technical guidance, \nsustainability was heralded as a priority \nat the national level, resulting in an array \nof policies, incentives and regulations \nthat bolstered industrial clustering \nand transformation via eco-industrial \nparks and activities such as industrial \nsymbiosis and remanufacturing. 103 \nThe environmental governance \nsystem was modernised to ensure \nthat standardisations, monitoring \nand innovation incentives rendered \noperational harmony across industries.\nThe manufacturing prowess and strategic \nblueprints of China’s EIPs further lent \nthemselves to the creation of a more \ncircular industrial sector. The sheer \nscale of its manufacturing provided a \nunique platform where industries could \nnaturally form symbiotic relationships. \nThe parks' designs were inherently \nstrategic, ensuring industrial clustering \nand transformation so that neighbouring \nindustries could share resources, \nthereby reducing costs and logistics-\nrelated constraints, for example. Finally, \nlocal governments played a crucial \nrole, adapting national guidelines to fit \nlocal contexts and providing requisite \nincentives. Meanwhile, local academic \ninstitutions and industries joined forces, \nhoning technological and process \ninnovations and fostering a relationship \nof ongoing research and development. 104, \n105\nLooking at China's journey, it is important \nto note that while the nation blazed \nsubstantial trails in championing \nindustrial sustainability, the path will \nnever be obstacle-free. For example, \nconcerns remain around total resource \nuse and lacking social impact research. 106 \nThe number of EIPs in China is also \nlimited compared to traditional industrial \nparks and zones and their type and size \nvaries considerably. Nevertheless, EIPs \nreduce virgin resource use, emissions \nand waste generation compared to \ntraditional industrial parks and zones. 107, \n108 EIPs have also been proven to drive \ninnovation, attract human and financial \ncapital, produce technology spillovers \nand positively impact surrounding \nareas.109 Other Grow  countries can extract \nvaluable lessons from China's successful \nstrategies and apply best practices \nwithin their own economies to chart their \nsustainable industrial trajectories.\n57\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n56\n",

These nations need more resources and face \ncompeting demands for investment in critical sectors \nlike healthcare, education and infrastructure. With \nlarge—and growing—populations, Build  countries \nalso face high levels of youth unemployment and \nunderemployment. Many workers are employed in \nthe informal economy: on one hand, this is often \ncharacterised by necessity-driven value-retaining \npractices for materials and goods, but it is also \nassociated with precarious employment, and limited \nor absent social protection and collective bargaining \nschemes. Women tend to be over-represented in \ninformal and vulnerable employment as they continue \nto face various barriers to accessing formal jobs. \nGender wage gaps persist within Build  countries’ \nlabour markets, and specific segments of marginalised \ngroups within society tend to face inequities such as \ndiscrimination and limited access to social protection.\nLooking ahead, Build  countries should leverage \ncircular practices that have long been present in \ntheir communities, as well as knowledge rooted \nin Indigenous groups. But they will also need to \ninvest in new technologies and practices that allow \nfor sustainable human development, particularly \nin material-intensive industries like food, energy \nand construction.

They also tend to be in the bottom \n40% based on income, putting them in a vulnerable \nposition. A circular food system—built on the \ncornerstones of wellbeing and resilience—can usher in \na new normal. \nIn a circular food system, regenerative  practices are \nthe norm: techniques like cover cropping, agroforestry \nand holistic grazing are applied at scale to nourish soil, \nsequester carbon and enhance biodiversity. Farmers \nhave access to both cutting-edge technologies and \nhigh-quality inputs as well as the knowledge and \nsupport necessary to use them, allowing them to \nfarm their land to the benefit of people and planet. \nSubstantial investment in education—especially in \nrural areas—results in a well-trained agricultural \nworkforce with abundant regenerative and circular \nknowledge. Thanks to circular  practices, such as a \ndiverse rotation of local crops and livestock, as well \nas techniques that boost production with minimal \nartificial fertilisers, food is organic, seasonal and \nhighly nutritious. All packaging is reusable and \ncompostable, helping cut waste throughout the value \nchain. Unavoidable biomass waste—surplus food and \ncrop residues, for example—is minimised by valorising \nand cascading to its maximum value. This includes \ncomposting so crucial nutrients return to the soil, \ndeveloping high-value products or converting it into \nbioenergy to sustainably power local communities. \nA circular food system feeds into wellbeing, too: local \nmarkets, cooperatives and farm-to-table initiatives \nconnect farmers with the people they feed, ensuring \ntheir access to fresh, sustainably-grown food while \nsecuring fair wages for farmers and access to land, \nand bringing more equitable opportunities for women. \nEducation and cultural events are used to cultivate \na deeper appreciation for farmers and the land they \nwork, and promote food literacy and traditional \nculinary practices. A circular food system ensures \nmore than sustainability—it nurtures nutrition and a \ndeeply-rooted sense of community, preserving cultural \nheritage and encouraging stewardship for the Earth.\nHow can we unlock this vision in Build  countries? \nWe envision a future where food is not just a \ncommodity but a vital source of life and community. \nUnlocking this vision, however, will require action \nthroughout the value chain; this includes the fair \npricing of regenerative practices and products, \nstrategic investments, supportive policies and \ncommunity-led initiatives. The keys to unlocking this \nvision include, but are not limited to:\nEnact policies that help unlock investment in \nmuch-needed climate mitigation and adaptation\nBuild countries need help to make essential \ninvestments in sustainability due to their excessive \ndebt burden. High-income, Western creditor countries \nhave the financial capacity, technological expertise, \nand global influence in global institutions to help \nlower-income countries unlock funds. This will be \nessential to advance smart material management \nand environmental stewardship aligned with climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation measures, including \necosystem preservation and regeneration.\n• Implement debt relief and fair access to \ncapital markets to national governments in \nBuild countries,  such as reliable nature-for-\ndebt swaps 112 and via Green Bonds and Climate \nFunds.113 Through the reduction of sovereign \ndebt burdens and fair and preferential access to \nfinancial markets, national governments have an \nincreased capacity to mobilise capital towards \nregenerative farming, nature-based solutions and \ninfrastructure. 114\n• Implement efficient, stable and transparent \nregulatory and business frameworks  that \nimprove how many resources and investment flow \ninto the agricultural sector to explicitly improve \nenvironmental and social outcomes. Coupled with \ndebt relief and cheap access to affordable capital—\nvia low interest rates, for example—a regulatory \nframework that sets a clear vision for environmental \nand social outcomes is key to minimise investment \nrisks and encourage efficient capital allocation. \n• Secure land rights and tenure policies to protect \nsmallholder farmers from land grabs, provide \nlegal recognition for customary land rights and/or \noffer long-term leases. This is critical for farmers’ \nconfidence in investing in and transitioning \ntowards long-term regenerative practices. \n• Set concrete policy targets for soil, water and \nbiodiversity  to establish long-term strategic goals \nand send clear signals to market players about \nwhere to invest in the future. Clear targets would \nunlock significant and sustained investments \nfrom large-scale farmers and multinational \ncorporations, encouraging the wide-scale adoption \nof regenerative practices. These targets should be \ncombined with financial incentives and monitoring \nframeworks that can provide feedback on how to \nsteer targets over time.\nStrengthen resilience in small- and medium-scale \nagriculture with improved market access\nThis would address barriers such as a lack of access \nto market information, limited market access, price \nvolatility and inadequate infrastructure. Ultimately, \nit could enable farmers to make more informed \ndecisions, reach a wider market and receive fair \ncompensation for their produce. This is crucial to \nenhance food security, boost farmers' income, and \nfoster sustainable agricultural practices.\n• Promote farming cooperatives by supporting \nand financing aggregator models where a central \nentity, such as a cooperative or social enterprise, \nconsolidates smallholder farmers' produce and \nprovides services such as access to finance and \ntechnical assistance. Additionally, fund ‘backbone \norganisations’ 115 that can deliver capacity-\nbuilding programmes, and test and scale digital \nsolutions. These organisations can also invest in \ntransportation and storage infrastructure to help \nsmallholder farmers overcome financial barriers \nand achieve economies of scale.\n• Update standards to help the creation of new \nmarkets that allow for circular practices such as \nthe use of byproducts or treatment of organic \nwaste, for example. Ensure that this is done \nefficiently and safely and support businesses and \nindividuals in adopting these practices.\nEnable farmers to invest in innovations to increase \nagricultural output and quality 116 \nOne of the key barriers in Build countries is farmers' \nlack of access to resources and formal education. \nBy increasing access to funding, skills development, \nknowledge and technology, farmers can steadily \nscale up regenerative and sustainable models of food \nproduction. \n• Credit farmers and landowners  engaging in \nregenerative agriculture for the restoration and \nstewardship of ecosystems. For example, reliable, \nhigh-quality carbon and biodiversity credits  \ncan be used to incentivise practices that sequester \ncarbon and improve soil health and biodiversity. \nThis would give farmers who are transitioning to—or \nmaintaining—regenerative agriculture additional \nincome, making regenerative practices more \nattractive and viable over the long-term.\n• Make the transition less risky for small-scale \nfarmers who fundamentally lack resources \nby increasing their access to financial and \ninsurance services such as grants, microfinance \nand smallholder loan guarantees. This makes \ninvestments in inputs like seeds and new equipment \nor practices that improve soil health more appealing \nand convenient.\nEnsure ‘future-proof’ skill-sets with training \nand skills pathways and recognise Indigenous, \nregenerative practices\nGaining the necessary knowledge and skills is a key \nbarrier due to the vast number of people working in \nagriculture in Build  countries. A proactive approach will \nbe necessary to endow current and future generations \nof workers in this sector with the knowledge and \npractical skills needed to achieve an ambitious \ntransformation of the food system. \n• Facilitate the transition from the informal to the \nformal economy for both workers and economic \nunits.

To combat the issues \nof food waste, land use change and the \nswelling cost of animal feed, the Kenya \nBureau of Standards has approved \nthree National Standards to support \nthe production of edible insects, as \nwell as their processed by-products. \nThese guidelines will instruct insect \nfarmers on how to ensure the safety of \ntheir product and meet environmental \nregulations, while gaining accreditations \nfor their businesses and certificates for \ntheir products. This will allow insect-\nbased products to be widely sold in \nKenya and beyond. 118\nWhile these National Standards \nare relatively new, research shows \nthe promising potential for impact: \nfarmed insects, such as the BSF, make \nexcellent livestock feed—with BSF-\nfed pigs reaching market weight a \nmonth earlier than their traditionally-\nfed counterparts. This can cut feed \ncosts by as much as 15% , both \nbenefiting farmers and reducing the \nland needed to grow crops for livestock \nconsumption. One study found that—at \nits current rate of production—African \ninsect farming could generate 14% \nof the crude protein needed to feed \nall the pigs, goats, fish and chickens \nacross the continent. By converting the \norganic waste generated each year in \nSub-Saharan Africa, insect farming has \nthe potential to save 86 million tonnes \nof CO2e—equivalent to removing 18 \nmillion vehicles from the road. Efficient \nconverters, insects can transform \nfood waste into a more useful form: \nwith the potential to recycle as much \nas 18 million tonnes of waste into \nfertiliser,  the BSF is a crucial pathway \nto greener, less polluted cities. Insect-\nbased fertilisers have proved incredibly \neffective, too: maize plots treated with \nBSF fertiliser resulted in yields 14% \nhigher than those treated with existing \ncommercial organic fertilisers. \nIf scaled, impacts could be even \nlarger: one 2020 study, for example, \nfound that replacing half of the fish \nmeal traditionally used in animal feed \nwith insect meal could make enough \nfish and maize available to feed an \nadditional 4.8 million people  each \nyear in Kenya alone—while providing \n33,000 additional jobs per year,  \nreducing poverty for an estimated 3.2 \nmillion people. 119 These results could be \nreplicable across Africa, and may even \nserve to kickstart women- or youth-led \nagricultural ventures—as both groups \nare often deterred from starting their \nown businesses due to lacking the \nnecessary capital.\n63\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n62\n",

In a circular built environment, \nwellbeing is addressed at every corner: urban planning \nmakes residents’ lives easier through compact, walkable \nneighbourhoods with reliable and well-connected public \ntransport. Owning or driving a car is far less desirable—\nwhy go to that effort when public transport is quick, \ncheap, safe and easy? In these neighbourhoods, air and \nnoise pollution are drastically lower, improving residents’ \nhealth, and public spaces are designed to foster \nconnection and belonging. \nBuildings are circular, too: local, sustainable materials—\nthink wood instead of concrete, for example—are used \nas efficiently as possible to cut waste at every stage, \nfrom design and construction to use and eventually \ndeconstruction. Structures are built to last, with a careful \nbalance struck between durability and material choice at \nthe design stage. Every building feature is designed for \npositive impact: walls and roofs are used to grow plants, \nfor example, boosting biodiversity and providing natural \ncooling. Passive House principles are applied to all new \nbuilds to cut energy demand as much as possible and \nmake the most of sunlight and fresh air—while excellent \ninsulation protects from heat, cold and moisture. At \nthe end of their lifetimes, buildings are deconstructed \nrather than demolished, so that every material and \ncomponent—from doors and windows to wooden \nbeams—can be used again. \nWorkers in the built environment value chain have \nseized existing and new roles and opportunities. They \nare fairly paid and protected from harm at work. They’re \nequipped with the skills needed to make this a success, \nfrom knowledge of material handling and design for \nsustainability to technical installation and testing and \nmachine operation. Financial resources are geared \ntowards the necessary capital investments needed to \nbuild a circular built environment. \nHow can we unlock this vision in Build  countries? \nOur circular vision for Build  countries’ built \nenvironment sees cities and towns that are \nsustainable, resilient and livable for all social strata, \noffering a high quality of life while minimising \nenvironmental impact. The keys to unlocking this \nvision include, but are not limited to:\nCultivate a conducive policy environment for a \ncircular built environment value chain\nBuild countries face challenges in enforcing \nbuilding codes and standards due to lack of follow-\nup mechanisms and because of the prevalence \nof informal construction and demand for cheap \nhousing. This can lead to subpar construction quality \nand inefficient material use as well as potential safety \nhazards.120 A lack of policy incentives to promote \ncircular economy practices coupled with inadequate \nwaste management and recycling infrastructure, \nas well as limited technology and innovation to \nrepurpose and reuse materials hinder the creation of \na circular built environment value chain. 121 \n• Develop and implement localised, tailored and \nsimplified building codes and set enhanced \nstandards  that prioritise and incentivise low-tech \nclimate-smart buildings, circular maintenance and \nrenovation, and the use of local, renewable and \nsecondary materials. \n• Leverage circular public procurement  to \nsupport traditional, circular building techniques \nand materials as well as demand for circular skills \nin construction by setting strict requirements \non the profiles and technical expertise needed. \nThis can stimulate local circular businesses by \nencouraging workforce development and local \nmanufacturing, and can create simpler and more \nlocal supply chains.\n• Identify dominant regional waste streams  \nand offer guidelines on safely and effectively \nintegrating waste into construction by converting \nit into building materials.\n• Ensure regulations prioritise circular practices \nsuch as repair, renovation, retrofitting and \nmaintenance, particularly given the high share \nof low-cost, low-quality and energy-inefficient \nbuildings.\nAllow local governments to plan and adapt for \ncircularity with financial and technical resources\nMany cities in Build  countries are grappling with \nthe complexities of rapid and uncontrolled urban \ngrowth, often in informal settlements. To address \nthese challenges, collaborative efforts that include \ngovernmental bodies, international organisations \nand local communities are essential to develop and \nimplement strategies that ensure urban development \nis both resource-efficient, sustainable and inclusive.\n• Use development funds to directly support urban \nplanning departments  with financial, technical and \nhuman resources to rapidly implement carefully-\nconsidered urban planning initiatives. These can \ninclude financing for capacity-building programmes \nand circular urban development plans for the \ndevelopment of resource-efficient and climate-\nsmart public spaces, infrastructure and services, \nthat can also make commercial developments more \npeople-centric and resilient. \n• Provide affordable access to capital and \ntechnologies —such as prefabrication and 3D \nprinting—to help scale practical solutions such as \nplastic sand bricks. Equip facilities to transform \nwaste into usable construction materials. \nFurthermore, roll out development funds to \nsubsidise the innovation required to utilise local \nmaterials at scale for commercial buildings, as \ncurrently, international materials are trusted more \nand are less expensive.\nFacilitate labour-intensive circular building \nsolutions with skills development and informal \neconomy processes \nThe construction sector in Build  countries is usually \npredominantly informal, characterised by a lack of \nregulation, inadequate working conditions and limited \naccess to finance and technical expertise. Moreover, \nthe skills and knowledge gap among professionals \nand workers in sustainable construction methods \nand material handling often hampers the integration \nof circular principles into design, construction and \nbuilding management. \n• Establish and fund training programmes and \nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training \n(TVET) courses  that equip local stakeholders with \nthe necessary skills and knowledge to implement \ncircular construction techniques, and improve \nknowledge of health and safety standards. Such \nprogrammes should make efforts to target \nmigrant workers, who often make up a majority of \nconstruction jobs. This special focus would address \nthe lack of expertise and develop a workforce \ncapable of delivering circular projects. 122 \n• Design, revise and update curricula to include \nrelevant skills  related to planning, designing, \nbuilding and managing circular built environments. \nEmbed circular economy thinking early in education \nto help train the next generation, and improve \nwomen’s access to the labour market by identifying \nopportunities across the entire value chain, from \ndesign to maintenance to end-of-life. The private \nsector, national government and skills agencies \nof each country need to work together to set this \ndirection and ensure that the provision of training \nmatches demand.\n• Ensure community participation  by involving \nlocal workers and businesses in decision-making \nfor construction projects, ensuring their needs and \ncultural values are considered, thus overcoming \nresistance and promoting community buy-in. Social \nprotection policies  can mitigate adverse impacts \nwhile supporting the transition's progression.\nCREATING A LEVEL POLICY \nPLAYING FIELD \nGETTING THE ECONOMICS RIGHT BUILDING CIRCULAR EXPERTISE \nAND SKILLS\n65\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n64\n",

      "content": "RWANDA’S CIRCULAR ECONOMY \nACTION PLAN EMBEDS \nCIRCULAR PRINCIPLES INTO THE \nCONSTRUCTION SECTOR.\nRwanda is experiencing the second \nhighest economic growth rate in Sub-\nSaharan Africa due to its booming \npopulation, an emerging middle class \nand increasing urbanisation. That being \nsaid, this economic upswing has brought \nunsustainable building practices along \nwith it—currently, standards related to \nbuildings’ design phase do not require \ncriteria for extended life cycles or a safe \ncycling of materials. Materials used for \nconstruction are largely imported, with \nonly a minority produced locally. While it \nwould serve the industry well to reduce \nits dependence on foreign imports \nof steel and cement—both lessening \nenvironmental impacts and building \nresilience—a lack of awareness and \nacceptance of circularity in the private \nsector and a lack of legal and financial \nincentives are preventing this.\nTo combat this, Rwanda’s Ministry of \nEnvironment published a Circular Economy \nAction Plan and Roadmap 123 in 2023. This \nAction Plan provides a clear vision for \nRwanda’s construction sector: to design, \nconstruct and use buildings in alignment \nwith circular principles and valorise \nconstruction and demolition waste \n(C&DW) in ways that enable high-quality \nreuse, recycling and recovery. The Action \nPlan outlines three priorities for the built \nenvironment in Rwanda alongside the \npractical solutions to make them possible. \nFirst, a revised national Building Code \nand the use of the Green Building \nCompliance System  should be enforced. \nThis means including circular principles in \nthe Rwanda Green Building Compliance \nSystem, and ensuring this system is applied \nto all buildings. Trainings and workshops \nshould be held that provide clear guidance \non the right application of the Building \nCode and the Compliance System, which \ncould be offered to construction companies \nby the Green Building Organisation and the \nRwanda Housing Authority. Ideally, each \nconstruction firm would have one or two \nin-house experts familiar with the Building \nCode and Compliance System, to help make \ncircular buildings the new normal.\nSecond, the Action Plan advises that \nrenewable and local materials and \nconstruction types should be prioritised \nbefore exhausting non-renewable \nmaterials.  This will entail using alternative \nconstruction materials as well as more \nlocal construction types like rammed earth \nconstruction. To carry this out, vocational \ntraining and guidelines for the informal \nsector must be developed on how to shift \nfrom conventional to local alternative \nconstruction materials and how to better \nintegrate into the formal sector.\nFinally, the Action Plan calls for the \ndevelopment of national guidelines \non how to characterise and valorise \nConstruction and Demolition Waste \n(C&DW).  National guidelines should \ninclude a transitory plan and clear \nguidance for construction companies and \nrecyclers to identify different types of \nwaste, which is essential for choosing the \nmost appropriate recycling or recovering \ntechnique. Techniques and enablers for \ndismantling, repairing and reusing building \nelements should also be established to \nprevent demolition and keep materials \nin use at their highest value. Lastly, the \nguidelines should contain guidance on \nhow to recycle different types of C&DW \nin the most circular way: avoiding low-\ngrade applications such as backfilling, for \nexample\nIt may be too soon to measure the impacts \nof the Circular Economy Action Plan and \nRoadmap  in Rwanda, but the Plan serves \nas a huge step in the right direction to \ntransforming a wasteful and material-\nintensive industry. What’s more, the Plan’s \npotential impacts transcend borders, \noffering a replicable framework for \ncountries with similar economies to work \ntowards a more circular built environment. \nEmpowering ALL workers \nthrough training and upskilling \nis the lifeblood propelling \nthe transition to a circular \neconomy.\nEllen Hoeijenbos, Netherlands \nTrade Union Confederation (FNV)\n67\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n66\n",

In aligning material use with societal needs, \nwe envision a world where the needs of all people are met \nwithin the safe boundaries of the planet. As illustrated in \nthis Report, a systems-oriented approach will be imperative \nto move from theory to action and achieve this collective \nvision of a safe and just space. This chapter highlights the key \nstakeholders that can create an enabling environment for \ncircular economy solutions to thrive, effectively transforming \nkey systems: among these are countries’ Ministries of Finance, \nEnvironment and Labour, labour unions, Multinational \nDevelopment Banks (MDBs), financial institutions, educational \ninstitutions, and the private sector. No one actor can spur \nchange alone: the transition calls for radical collaboration \nand concerted efforts to avoid burden shifting among \nindustries, regions and resources—striving for a harmonious \ntransformation of production and consumption.

This will \nbe critical to unlock the potential of the circular \neconomy to improve and sustain social outcomes \nfor nations while respecting environmental \nlimits.126, 127 The private sector must be part of the \ntransformation, but reducing risks that attract \nprivate finance for development is crucial. These \nendeavours should be carried out at the local level, \nwith robust public oversight. This approach is vital \nto prevent low-income countries from becoming \noverly reliant on the current structure of value \nchains and global financial capital. 128 \nHOW?\n• Develop and apply holistic indicators.  We must \nmove beyond GDP and other traditional economic \nmetrics to incorporate indicators that measure the \nthings that matter to people: from environmental \nhealth to social equity, decent work and human \nwellbeing. This is necessary to sketch a clearer picture \nof how—and to what end—economies are progressing \nand developing. Better data and indicators are \nneeded to show how environmental and economic \nactivities can promote human wellbeing, including \nthrough decent job opportunities. 124\n• Set mission-oriented targets.  New targets are \nneeded to shift the goal from maximising economic \noutput to maximising human wellbeing within \nplanetary boundaries. Add to existing targets for \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by setting \ncaps on total material use and waste generation that \nprogressively and rapidly decline until sustainable \nlevels are reached—and do so at the needed speed, \nscope and scale to achieve intended outcomes. 125 \nAt the same time, ensure that the development of \nthese environmental targets is adaptive and dynamic: \nit must centre on building resilience while being \nresponsive to emerging challenges, technological \nadvancements and changing societal needs in our \nincreasingly uncertain and rapidly evolving world.\n• Increase fair access to affordable circular and \ngreen technological innovations.  Introducing \nintellectual property rights (IPRs) waivers can \nsupport technological transfer to improve access to \nnecessary existing technologies, while rethinking \ntrade policy will also foster necessary innovation \nin Build countries. 129 This can apply to clean energy \ntechnologies, technological innovation for resource-\nefficient industrial processes, alternative protein \ntechnologies, and more. This can enable Build \ncountries to leapfrog and ‘bend the curve’. 130 \n• Roll out measures for debt cancellation and \nrelief. Currently, despite contributing the least to \nclimate change, many Build and Grow nations have \naccrued substantial debts, making it extremely \ndifficult for them to prioritise sustainable and low-\ncarbon investments. Debt cancellation and relief \nfor Build and Grow countries is essential because \nit frees up financial resources—enabling these \nnations to invest in the circular economy transition, \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, ecosystem \nrestoration, and resilience-building measures rather \nthan funnelling their limited resources into debt \nrepayment. 131, 132 Shift countries can directly support \nthese efforts, particularly by ensuring multilateral \nfinancial institutions provide direct funding and \nprioritise access to affordable capital. 133\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economy, Finance \nand the Environment,\nBusiness leaders,\nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development \n(OECD), \nInternational Financial Institutions \n(such as the IMF and Development \nBanks).\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economics, Finance \nand Trade,\nInternational Financial Institutions,\nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe World Trade Organization).\n71\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n70\n",

This should include those \nlinked to environmental and health impacts, and \ncan be done through carbon pricing and resource \ntaxes, for example. 134 Similarly, subsidies must be \nredirected away from high-impact activities and \nproducts—from meat 135 and SUVs to fast fashion \nand air travel—and towards activities with positive \nimpact: those that minimise raw material extraction, \nregenerate ecosystems and provide social value. 136 \nPublic support can be funnelled into these activities \nthrough tax deductions, preferential investment \nHOW?\n• Ensure the circular economy transition is people-\ncentric.  As important as what needs to be done to \ntackle climate breakdown, it’s also how these things \nare done that matters. As people—citizens, workers \nand employers—lie at the core of all economies, \nshifting how our economies function requires \npeople-centred approaches. Working towards a just \ntransition means leaving no one behind. \n• Build substantial support and leadership \namong governments around the world for \nthis social transition to take place. The time \nis ripe for a modern version of Franklin D. \nRoosevelt’s New Deal 141 to address economic \ninequality, infrastructure investment, social \nconditions and subsidies. \n• Dismantle incentives for excessive material \nconsumption.  Modern societies are marked by \nstark inequalities, with some living on very little \nwhile others consume excessively, driving the \nlion’s share of environmental damage. A key way to \naddress this systemic issue is through the taxation \nof luxury goods. 137 By doing so, we can not only \ncurb excessive consumption but also channel the \ngenerated revenue into public goods. These public \ngoods, such as improved public transport, parks and \nhealthcare, have the potential to benefit everyone, \nfostering a shift from a scenario of public neglect \nand private opulence to one of private sufficiency \nand public prosperity. 138\n• Complement pricing signals with fee-and-\ndividend schemes. 139 While true pricing is \nnecessary, it can’t steer change alone. Other \nmechanisms can also complement and reinforce \nbetter pricing, with the ultimate aim of limiting \ninflation and fostering social support for profound \nchanges. For example, fee-and-dividend approaches \nthat collect revenue from societies most polluting \nactivities and directed towards essential services \nthat mitigate impacts that disproportionately affect \nthe most vulnerable in society. Raised proceeds \non different assets—from carbon emissions and \nraw material extraction to land value to personal \ndata—can be recirculated, mitigating potential \ndisproportionate impacts on the poor. 140\nwelfare and environmental sustainability. \nTransitioning towards a circular economy requires \nstate planning, strong social policy and the \nimplementation of specialised public labour \nagencies that manage the transition of workers. \nSocial protection policies should ensure that all \nworkers can be supported and benefit from the \ntransition.\n• Harness policymakers’ creativity to achieve \nresults within a tight timeframe. This entails the \ndevelopment of subsidised green contracts and \njob guarantees. In Shift  countries, job guarantees \nand Just Transition Funds can be used to support \nworkers in resource-intensive industries that will \nundergo changes, both in their own countries \nand in partner Grow  and Build  countries. These \nhave already been rolled out in the EU and the US, \nfor example; while the International Just Energy \nTransition Partnership between South Africa, \nFrance, Germany, the UK and the US could be used \nas an example to learn from. \n• Ensure education addresses the inevitable \nshift in jobs and skills. It is vital that the right \nbasic education, vocational education and training \n(VET) and lifelong learning opportunities are made \navailable now. Investment in and support for VET \nreforms should be a high priority, and aligned with \nindustrial and environmental strategies. In parallel \nto foundational courses, micro-certifications \nshould be developed in order to meet immediate \ndemand in some sectors. Companies should also \nbe encouraged to invest in new green skills so \ntheir workers are equipped for the future. \n• Ensure that circular, green employment \nmeans better employment.  This includes \nbetter representation, decent pay and improved \nworking conditions. No matter what corner of \nthe world or the value chain we find ourselves \nin, it is crucial that people everywhere have the \nopportunity to lead dignified lives. Work is a \ncentral part of delivering on that goal, and social \ndialogue, social protection and skills development \nfor a sustainable economy is universally needed. \nWorkers across industries must be given the \nsecurity and insurance that their working \nconditions and lives will improve as a result of the \ntransition, not deteriorate. Unemployment and \nviolent geographical relocations must be avoided \nto the greatest extent possible, while workers’ \ninterests must be protected in the transition.\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economy and Finance,\nAcademic and educational \ninstitutions, \nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe World Trade Organization and \nthe OECD),\nInternational Financial Institutions \n(such as the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank).\nWHO?\nMinistries of Economy and Labour,\nMultilateral organisations (such as \nthe UN, the World Trade \nOrganization and the World Bank),\nLabour agencies and unions,\nBusiness leaders and,\nEducational institutions. \n73\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2024\n72\n",

It excludes water \nand air. [Source]\nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC)  is an \nenvironmental indicator that covers the flows of \nboth products and raw materials by accounting for \ntheir mass. It can take an ‘apparent consumption’ \nperspective—the mathematical sum of domestic \nproduction and imports, minus exports—without \nconsidering changes in stocks. It can also take a ‘direct \nconsumption’ perspective, in that products for import \nand export do not account for the inputs—be they raw \nmaterials or other products—used in their production. \n[Own elaboration based on Source ]\nEconomy-wide material flow accounts (EW-MFA)  \nare a 'statistical accounting framework describing the \nphysical interaction of the economy with the natural \nenvironment and with the rest of the world economy in \nterms of flows of materials.' [ Source]\nEnvironmental stressor , in Input-Output Analysis, is \ndefined as the environmental impact occurring within \nthe region subject to analysis. There is, therefore, \nan overlap between the stressor and the footprint, \nas they both include the share of impact occurring \nwithin a region as a result of domestic consumption. \nThis is how they differ: while the rest of the stressor \nis made up of impacts occurring within a region as a \nresult of consumption abroad (embodied in exports), \nthe footprint includes impacts occurring abroad \nas a result of domestic consumption (embodied in \nimports).\nGreenhouse gases (GHG)  refers to a group of \ngases contributing to global warming and climate \nbreakdown. The term covers seven greenhouse \ngases divided into two categories. Converting them \nto carbon dioxide equivalents  (CO2e) through the \napplication of characterisation factors makes it \npossible to compare them and to determine their \nindividual and total contributions to Global Warming \nPotential (see below). [ Source]\nHigh-value recycling  refers to the extent to \nwhich, through the recycling chain, the distinct \ncharacteristics of a material (the polymer, the glass \nor the paper fibre, for example) are preserved or \nrecovered so as to maximise their potential to be re-\nused in a circular economy. [ Source]\nMaterials , substances or compounds are used as \ninputs to production or manufacturing because \nof their properties. A material can be defined at \ndifferent stages of its life cycle: unprocessed (or \nraw) materials, intermediate materials and finished \nmaterials. For example, iron ore is mined and \nprocessed into crude iron, which in turn is refined \nand processed into steel. Each of these can be \nreferred to as materials. [ Source]\nMaterial footprint , also referred to as Raw Material \nConsumption (RMC), is the attribution of global \nmaterial extraction to the domestic final demand of a \ncity. In this sense, the material footprint represents the \ntotal volume of materials (in Raw Material Equivalents) \nembodied within the whole supply chain to meet final \ndemand. The total material footprint, as referred to \nin this report, is the sum of the material footprints \nfor biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic \nminerals. It is composed of the sum of domestic \nextraction and imports in raw material equivalents, \nminus exports in raw material equivalents. This \nallows us to allocate the footprint to the consumption. \n[Source]\nMaterial flows represent the amounts of materials \nin physical weight that are available to an economy. \nThese material flows comprise the extraction of \nmaterials within the economy as well as the physical \nimports and exports (such as the mass of goods \nimported or exported). Air and water are generally \nexcluded. [ Source]\nNet Extraction Abroad (NEA) represents the \ndifference between the trade balance of products and \nthat of the raw materials needed to produce them. The \ndifference between the two represents the 'actual' or \nnet quantity of raw materials that have been extracted \nabroad to satisfy domestic consumption.\nPlanetary boundaries  define the ‘safe operating \nspace’ for humanity, based on the planet’s key \nbiophysical processes. Originally developed by \nRockstr öm et al. (2009), the framework quantifies \nnine ‘limits’: 1. Climate change, 2. Novel entities, 336 3. \nStratospheric ozone depletion, 4. Atmospheric aerosol \nloading, 5. Ocean acidification, 6. Biogeochemical flows \n(nitrogen and phosphorus), 7. Freshwater use, 8. Land-\nsystem change, and 9. Biosphere integrity. 337 Six of \nnine boundaries have now been transgressed. [ Source]\nRaw Material Equivalent (RME)  is a virtual unit that \nmeasures how much of a material was extracted \nfrom the environment, domestically or abroad, \nto produce the product for final use. Imports and \nexports in RME are usually much higher than their \ncorresponding physical weight, especially for finished \nand semi-finished products. For example, traded \ngoods are converted into their RME to obtain a more \ncomprehensive picture of the ‘material footprints’; \nthe amounts of raw materials required to provide the \nrespective traded goods. [ Source]\nRaw Material Consumption (RMC)  represents the \nfinal domestic use of products in terms of RME. RMC, \nreferred to in this report as the 'material footprint', \ncaptures the total amount of raw materials required \nto produce the goods used by the economy. In other \nwords, the material extraction necessary to enable the \nfinal use of products. [ Source]\nResources  include, for example, arable land, \nfreshwater, and materials. They are seen as parts \nof the natural world that can be used for economic \nactivities that produce goods and services. Material \nresources are biomass (like crops for food, energy \nand bio-based materials, as well as wood for energy \nand industrial uses), fossil fuels (in particular coal, gas \nand oil for energy), metals (such as iron, aluminium \nand copper used in construction and electronics \nmanufacturing) and non-metallic minerals (used for \nconstruction, notably sand, gravel and limestone). \n[Source]\nSecondary materials  are materials that have been \nused once and are recovered and reprocessed for \nsubsequent use. This refers to the amount of the \noutflow which can be recovered to be re-used or \nrefined to re-enter the production stream. One \naim of dematerialisation is to increase the amount \nof secondary materials used in production and \nconsumption to create a more circular economy. \n[Source]\n81\n80\nThe Circularity Gap Report | Munich",

It comprises all \ntypes of recycled and downcycled end-of-life waste, \nwhich is fed back into production as secondary \nmaterials.

Over the past five years, the volume of discussions, debates, and articles addressing this topic has almost tripled, reflecting a heightened awareness and interest in circularity. However, the vast majority of extracted materials entering the economy are virgin, with the share of secondary materials declining steadily.  Meanwhile, the total amount of materials consumed by the global economy continues to rise. These statistics display the cold, hard truth: lofty speeches and targets are not yet translating into on-the-ground actions and measurable impacts. Without bold, urgent action to shift to a circular economy, we'll miss out on achieving broader social and environmental goals.\n\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2023 found that adopting 16 circular economy solutions could reverse the overshoot of planetary boundaries and slash the global need for material extraction by one-third. This reduction is rooted in the circular economy principles of using less for longer, using regenerative materials and cycling materials at their end-of-life.  While material consumption has been instrumental in raising living standards, we've reached a point where its continued acceleration no longer guarantees increases in human wellbeing. The unequal distribution of wealth and materials hugely destabilizes society and strains Earth's life support systems.\n\nTo walk the talk, governments and industry must break free of flawed development patterns. They can do this by unlocking capital, rolling out bold, contextually-appropriate policies and closing the sustainable and circular skills gap. This year’s Report shifts from exploring the *what* to the *how*, exploring ways to create conditions that discourage the overshoot of planetary boundaries and ‘undershoot’ of human development. This involves:\n\n*   **Create a level policy playing field:** Set the ‘rules of the game’ through policies that incentivise sustainable and circular practices.\n*   **Get the economics right:** Adjust fiscal policies and leverage public investment to create true prices for circular solutions.\n*   **Build circular expertise and skills:** Ensure people are skilled and trained to ensure a just transition.\n\nFor a just transition, we must take a systems-thinking approach.  Although human wellbeing is a broad concept, this Report focuses on how the circular transition can support wellbeing through the provision of decent work.  A future-proof system must galvanise wellbeing by funnelling materials into industries and practices that lift people up and repair the damage done to the ecosystems upon which we depend, while degrowing harmful ones—especially in higher-income countries.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "Despite growing awareness and discussion, the global circular economy is failing to reduce material consumption.  The 2023 Circularity Gap Report highlights that while ambitious targets are set, material extraction remains overwhelmingly reliant on virgin materials.  To address this, the report advocates for 16 circular economy solutions to reduce material extraction by one-third, focusing on using less, using regenerative materials, and effective material cycling.  This requires governments and industry to implement policies that incentivize circular practices, correct market failures through fiscal policies, and address the skills gap to ensure a just transition that prioritizes human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, particularly by degrowing harmful industries in wealthier nations.\n",

      "content": "<chunk>\n## The Ultimate Challenge of the 21st Century\n\nMaterial consumption has been instrumental in raising living standards over the past century, enhancing life expectancy, increasing employment, and improving education. However, as living standards rise, so does ecological impact. Material consumption is a solid proxy for environmental damage, with material handling and use contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and water stress.  \n\nThe modern economy's linear practices have driven exponential growth in material consumption, pollution, and waste generation. This puts unsustainable pressure on Earth’s ecosystems. Resource distribution and drivers of environmental impacts are increasingly unequal, with high-income nations being key drivers of ecological breakdown. The unequal distribution of wealth and materials puts immense strain on Earth's systems and destabilizes societies. The continued acceleration of material consumption no longer delivers wellbeing and desirable progress in many high-income nations.\n\nRethinking material consumption is crucial for ‘bending the development curve’ towards a more environmentally safe and socially just future.  Countries with strong economies should reduce their material footprints to free up ecological space for those needing to expand their economies. Redistributing material resources is critical to ensuring universal access to basic needs while staying within Earth's safe limits.  The circular economy's principles of using less, using longer, making clean and using again can deliver a high quality of life within planetary boundaries.  The Circularity Gap Report 2023 findings show this is possible: societal needs can be met with 30% less material, reversing the overshoot of five planetary boundaries.\n</chunk>",
      "summary": "Unsustainable material consumption, driven by economic growth, causes significant environmental damage and social inequality.  High-income nations are primarily responsible, demanding a reduction in their material footprint to allow for developing nations' growth. Transitioning to a circular economy, emphasizing reduced consumption and reuse, is vital for achieving a sustainable and equitable future, as demonstrated by the potential for a 30% reduction in material use while meeting societal needs.\n",

The report focuses on transformative circular solutions across these systems:\n\n**The Food System:**  Drives a quarter of the overshoot on the climate change planetary boundary due to GHG production, uses over one-quarter of all land, loses nearly a quarter of freshwater resources due to food waste, and is the single largest driver of biodiversity loss.\n\n**The Built Environment:** Extraction of minerals for construction materials is responsible for a quarter of global land use change; buildings account for approximately 40% of global GHG emissions; and construction and demolition processes drive nearly one-third of all material consumption.\n\n**Manufactured Goods:** Production processes often rely on fossil fuels and drive one-third of the overshoot on the climate change planetary boundary; material- and energy-intensive activities are linked to deforestation; and manufacturing results in substantial amounts of hazardous industrial waste.\n\nTo achieve global wellbeing within planetary boundaries, we must prioritize circularity-based development in lower-income Build countries, promote circular industrial processes in Grow countries, and shift consumption patterns in higher-income Shift nations.  Different countries will have different priorities in scaling a global circular economy.\n</chunk>",

They consume far more than their share of materials, generating a disproportionate share of global emissions. Their mission is to reduce material consumption and lessen their impact on planetary boundaries.\n\n**Grow countries (middle-income):** Should stabilize their material consumption. They account for a large share of the global material footprint and emissions.  Their focus should be on improving their people's quality of life in a way that is sensitive to planetary boundaries.\n\n**Build countries (low-income):** Should increase their material consumption to fulfill their populations' needs. Their material footprint per capita is below the estimated sustainable level. Their primary objective is to improve living standards, necessitating increased material use to provide necessary infrastructure, goods, and services.\n\nThe report identifies the most impactful circular solutions for each country profile, focusing on key systems (food, built environment, manufactured goods) and highlighting specific leverage points for action.\n</chunk>",

The report emphasizes the interconnectedness of policy, finance, and people in driving the circular transition.\n\n**Policy:**  Sets the rules of the game, incentivizing sustainable practices and penalizing harmful ones.  Effective legislation requires strong enforcement.\n\n**Finance:**  Directs capital flows, determining which activities and businesses are funded and scaled.  Financing is crucial for circular solutions to replace linear practices.  Addressing systemic levers like environmental fiscal reform and debt alleviation is vital.\n\n**People:** Are key agents and beneficiaries of change.  Their skills, jobs, awareness, and choices are crucial.  Aligning laws, capital flows, and opportunities for people with circular economy principles is essential.\n\nThe report highlights how policy, finance, and people must work together to overcome challenges specific to different country profiles and systems.
