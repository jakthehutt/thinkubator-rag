After seven years of reporting, our message \nremains much the same: in the face of escalating \nglobal challenges, the circular economy offers a \nmeans to rewire the entrenched linear practices that \nno longer serve most people or the planet. Since the \nlaunch of the first Circularity Gap Report in 2018, we’ve \nanalysed the Circularity Metric to offer insight into \nthe global state of the circular economy transition.\n1 \nThis single figure quantifies the share of secondary \nmaterials out of total material consumption, serving \nas a North Star for tracking progress towards the \ncircular transition. But the Metric is one piece of a \nlarger puzzle. That’s why, for the first time, this report \nanalyses the Circularity Gap to examine how the rest \nof the materials flowing into and out of the global \neconomy are contributing to a circular economy—or \nnot. Global material flows can be broken down into \nthree interconnected categories:\n•\n C\nircular:  Secondary Materials (the Circularity Metric) \nand Carbon-Neutral Biomass;\n• L\ninear: Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass, Fossil Fuels \ncombusted for energy, and other Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials destined for landfill;\n•\n P\notentially circular, potentially linear:  Net \nadditions of virgin materials to Stocks—such as \nbuildings, infrastructure, and machinery—that can \neither be recycled or wasted at their end-of-life \nmany years down the road.\nThis report examines how materials enter the \neconomy, whether they re-enter it and, if not, how \nthey leave it—either as waste or emissions. Various \nsub-indicators support each of the headline indicators \nabove to give a sense of where we are, where we’re \nheading, and where targets are needed to drive action \nin the right direction. This year’s report serves as a \ndata-rich, comprehensive report card for the global \nstate of circularity, opening up the Circularity Gap to \nsupport practical decision-making.\nExecutive summary\nPote ntia l ly \ncircular\nPote ntia l ly \nlinear\nCircular Linear\nSecondary  \nMaterials\nNon-Renewable \nMaterials destined for \nLandfill\nNon-Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass\nFossil Fuels \ncombusted for Energy\nCarbon-Neutral \nBiomass\nStocks\n10\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nThe verdict  \nWithout strong global targets to hold us \nto the right path, we’re veering off course \nfor several key indicators. Natural resource \nmanagement and global material use trends \nare moving in the wrong direction: material \nextraction and waste generation are trending \nupwards, while recycling and controlled \ndisposal rates are both trending downwards \nover a five-year period. What’s more, official, \nscience-based global material use targets are \nlacking, making it difficult to drive progress.\nIn an ideal world, \nwe use as many secondary materials as possible \nwhile minimising extraction and consumption. \nIndustries have embraced principles of material \nefficiency and sufficiency, prioritising the use \nof recycled inputs alongside circular design \nprinciples. Material recovery from long-lived \nstocks—such as buildings and infrastructure, \nwhich can act as ‘banks’ of materials for \nreuse—has been optimised. At the same time, \ncountries have vastly improved waste collection, \nprocessing and recycling and have minimised \nwaste from extraction processes.\nThe Circularity Metric continues to \ndecline: the vast majority of materials \nentering the economy are virgin, with \nthe share of secondary materials \nfalling from 7.2% to 6.9% as of the \nlatest analysis. \nOngoing declines in circularity can largely be tied \nto sustained growth in material use. Although the \nabsolute scale of secondary material consumption \nis slowly trending upwards, this is being outpaced \nby growth in virgin material use. Global extraction \nhas more than tripled in the last fifty years, recently \nreaching a landmark 100 billion tonnes—and without \n‘bending the trend’, this is set to rise by a further  \n60% by 2060.\n2 \nA truly circular economy should be resource-light: \nwithout profoundly rewiring systems of production \nand consumption and applying structural changes \nacross key systems—from housing and food to \nmobility and manufacturing—we will not be able to \nclose the loop on material consumption. At the same \ntime, there is a significant opportunity to bolster \nthe Circularity Metric by recycling all the materials \nthat potentially could\n3 be cycled but currently aren’t. \nVirgin, Non-Renewable Materials destined for \nlandfill—including heavy industrial wastes, short-\nlived consumer products, and end-of-life vehicles or \nconstruction materials—account for nearly one-fifth \n(18.1%) of global material inputs. This represents huge \nuntapped potential: if we were to recycle all waste \ncurrently not being recycled without  reducing overall \nmaterial use, for example, the Circularity Metric would \ngrow to approximately 25%. \nThere is potential to boost circularity by better-\nmanaging construction and demolition waste, as well \nas smaller waste streams, like municipal solid waste. \nHowever, a good portion of Virgin, Non-Renewable \nMaterials are hard-to-recycle, lower-value waste types, \nfrom waste rock to soils, underscoring the importance \nof rolling out circular strategies that minimise waste \nfrom the outset while prioritising high-value reuse and \nrecycling where possible. \n \n11\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nA sustainable bioeconomy is \nimportant to the global circular \neconomy transition, but measuring its \nimpact remains a blind spot. \nOf all the materials flowing into the global economy, \n21.5% are Carbon-Neutral Biomass, and 2.2%  are Non-\nCarbon-Neutral Biomass.* Carbon-Neutral Biomass \nrefers to biomass that absorbs as much carbon as \nit emits over its lifecycle, maintaining a balance \nthrough natural processes like regrowth and carbon \nsequestration. \nNon-Carbon-Neutral Biomass represents the portion \nthat exceeds this balance: it doesn’t imply a difference \nin how the biomass is extracted but rather reflects \nthat a certain proportion is ‘in the red’. However, all \nbiomass extraction comes with numerous uncaptured \nenvironmental impacts. Although renewable, biomass \nisn’t sustainable by default, and carbon neutrality is \nonly a partial criterion for quantifying its circularity. \nBy only considering this aspect, we can’t account for \nthe loss of ecological complexity and biodiversity \nthat biomass extraction may cause—for example, \nlarge-scale monoculture plantations can deplete soil \nnutrients, reduce habitat diversity, and contribute to \ndeforestation, threatening ecosystems and species.  \nIt is not currently possible to measure other important \ncriteria for circular biomass, such as whether nutrients \nare safely returned to the biosphere in the right place \nand at the right rate. For this reason, even Carbon-\nNeutral Biomass should be considered carefully and \nwith nuance. Though Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass \naccounts for just 2.2% of material inputs, it represents \napproximately one-tenth of total biomass use—still a \ncrucial share to minimise. \nDespite its declining share in global material \nextraction, the scale of biomass extraction has more \nthan doubled in the last half-century, driving land-\nuse change and biodiversity loss and accounting for \na significant portion of global emissions. Developing \na more circular economy will require a rebalancing of \nglobal land use: currently, a disproportionate share of \nthe planet’s land is used for agriculture—particularly \nfor pasture and feed crops. Transforming our food \nsystems towards circular, regenerative practices \nand plant-based, unprocessed diets will be critical to \nreducing these pressures and restoring ecosystems.\nThe verdict  \nWe’re making some progress, but more  \nmust be done to help meet global targets. \nGlobal biomass extraction and other key \nindicators—water stress, for example—are \ntrending upwards, while the share of forested \nland is decreasing. While we are making \nprogress at safely treating wastewater and \nbolstering land protection, progress isn’t \nhappening at the speed and scope needed to \nmeet global climate and biodiversity targets. \nWithout accelerated action, ecosystems \nmay struggle to sustain the industries and \ncommunities that depend on them.\nIn an ideal world, \nwe’ve reduced the land footprint intensity \nof biomass production and use biomass in \na way that respects natural cycles—such as \nthe carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water \ncycles—prevents the harmful transformation  \nof land, nurtures biodiversity and soil health, \nand maximises value through cascading  \nwhere possible.\n*  A much smaller share of biomass is captured by other indicators, \nmaking its way into the technical cycle and contributing to the \nCircularity Metric, Virgin, Non-Renewable Materials destined for \ndisposal, or Net Additions to Stock.\n12\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nFossil fuel use remains high and \ncontinues growing, with few strong \nincentives to change course. \nAlthough the rate of fossil fuel extraction relative \nto other materials has declined, absolute extraction \nhas increased—from 6.1 billion tonnes in 1970 to \n15.8 billion tonnes in 2021.\n4 13.3% of materials \nflowing into the economy are Fossil Fuels combusted \nfor energy, the main driver of climate breakdown. \nIn 2021, energy use accounted for 73%\n5 of global \ngreenhouse gas emissions—excluding those from \nland use, land-use change and forestry—with fossil \nfuels remaining the dominant energy source today, \nrepresenting 82% of total primary energy supply.\n6 \nHistorically, fossil fuel demand and global economic \ngrowth have been closely coupled—and even now, \ntheir use continues to be incentivised through \nartificially low prices, with explicit subsidies \namounting to an estimated US$1.4 trillion in 2021.\n7 \nThe transition to a net-zero energy system presents \na major opportunity to reduce reliance on fossil \nfuels while mitigating environmental harm. To do \nthis, we should systematically restructure how we \npower transport, generate electricity and process \nmaterials. This requires scaling down these activities \nand reorienting financial flows from subsidies \ntowards decarbonised systems based on electricity \nand powered by renewable sources. Although the \nenergy transition will initially be material-intensive—\nparticularly in terms of metals—smart system  \ndesign can reduce reliance on present and future \nmaterial inputs. This contrasts with the current  \nenergy system, which requires a constant flow of  \nfossil fuels to sustain. \nAdopting circular design principles—such as durability, \nreuse, and recycling—at both the product and the \nsystem level will be crucial to minimise environmental \nburden shifting, such as halting fossil fuel extraction \nbut ramping up mining.\nThe verdict  \nWhile there’s been some progress towards \ndecarbonisation, it isn’t enough to limit \nwarming to 1.5-degrees. Total energy \nsupply and global greenhouse gas emissions \nare still trending upwards—and while we’re \nseeing positive increases in electrification \nand renewable energy consumption, we’re \nnot yet on track to meet global targets. \nElectrification, for example, is growing more \nslowly than energy demand, and the carbon \nintensity of electricity generation is growing. \nWhat’s more, half of the waste generated by \nthe global economy is released in the form of \nemissions: because we can’t ‘close the loop’ on \nemissions, this represents a significant barrier \nto bolstering circularity.\nIn an ideal world, \nwe’ve prioritised systemic efficiency to keep \ngrowing energy demand in check, enabling \nrenewable energy to replace—rather than \nsimply add to—fossil-based sources in \nthe energy mix. Because electricity is the \nmost efficient and easiest form of energy to \ndecarbonise, we’ve electrified as many activities \nand end uses as possible and powered them \nwith clean renewables.\n13\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nRapid stock accumulation is a \nprimary driver of rising resource \nextraction—particularly non-\nmetallic minerals, which account \nfor half of total extraction. \nOf all materials entering the global economy,  \n38% are virgin Net Additions to Stock. This includes \nnon-metallic minerals, metals, and small amounts \nof fossil-fuel-based materials and biomass used \nprimarily for buildings, infrastructure, vehicles  \nand machinery. \nStocks aren’t inherently positive or negative and \neven have serious potential to boost circularity \ndown the road if circular design principles are \nintegrated now. By ‘mining’ existing stocks, we can \nexpand the pool of recyclable materials available \nto increase the Circularity Metric. However, stocks \nare highly material-intensive, with their total weight \nincreasing 23-fold over the 20th century, 8 a trend \nset to continue alongside rapid urbanisation and \neconomic growth. \nBy 2050, urban populations will grow by 2.5 billion, \nrequiring significant stock build-up, 9 particularly in \nlower- and middle-income countries. These nations \nhave the opportunity to embed circular principles \nat scale, avoiding the unsustainable development \npatterns of higher-income countries by prioritising \ndense urban environments supported by public and \nshared mobility options. Meanwhile, higher-income \ncountries with vast existing stocks should minimise \nnew stock growth and focus on extending the lifetime \nof existing stock through renovation, repurposing, \nreuse and repair.\nThe verdict  \nWe’re using more materials than ever to \nbuild up stocks—but targets to guide how \nand at what rate this is done are lacking \nacross the board. Total floor space, the weight \nof material stocks and growth in built-up areas \nare all trending upwards. With a complete lack \nof global and sub-global targets, we’re neither \non nor off track—technically speaking.  \nLimiting stock growth—in both incremental  \nand cumulative terms—where it’s not  \nnecessary and sustainably optimising it  \nthrough circular design where it is will be \nessential going forward.\nIn an ideal world, \ncircular practices like repair, retrofitting and \nrefurbishing are commonplace ways to keep \nphysical assets in use for as long as possible. \nStocks are designed for longevity, and are \neasy to repair, dismantle and recycle at their \nend of life—thus providing a flow of valuable \nsecondary materials. Renewable materials, such \nas sustainably-sourced timber, biocement and \nbiocomposites, contribute to stock composition, \nand are managed in a circular way. Operations \nare localised as much as possible to reduce \nenergy consumption for unnecessary transport. \n14\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nGovernments have a key opportunity to lead \nthe circular transition through smart policies \nand transparent multilateral collaboration. By \nsetting a clear vision and providing unified support \nfor circular initiatives, governments have the critical \nmandate to shape the right conditions for circularity \nto flourish—levelling the playing field by shifting \ntax burdens, reorienting subsidies away from linear \nactivities, and redirecting government funds towards \ncircular projects and initiatives. However, no country \ncan tackle resource use reduction in isolation: \ntransition in our highly globalised world ought to \nbe backed by strong regional—and, where possible, \ninternational—collaboration to effectively manage \nglobal material flows and reduce extraction. Despite \ngrowing recognition of the need to tackle resource \nmismanagement and align economic activity with our \nplanet’s safe limits, this report highlights the lack of \nboth clear targets and a global governance framework \nto monitor the shift to more sustainable resource use. \nAn international institution on resource management \ncould steer action by providing science-based \nassessments, policy guidance, and benchmarks to \ntrack material use—an approach already reflected in \nthe negotiating text of the legally binding agreement \non plastics pollution, for example.\n10 At the national \nlevel, governments should select and monitor reliable \nindicators—such as those analysed for this report—\nto create accountability, identify trends, and refine \npolicies over time, ensuring that circularity efforts  \nhave the intended impact. \nBusinesses that adopt circular practices now \ncan gain a competitive edge, unlock new \nrevenue streams, and future-proof against \nresource scarcity and market volatility. Although \ngovernments set regulatory frameworks, businesses \nshouldn’t wait for these to come into force to \nbegin shaping their new normal. By staying ahead \nof the regulatory curve and spearheading the \ntransition now, businesses have a lot to gain: they \ncan gain a competitive edge, unlock new revenue \nstreams (through service models, for example), and \nmitigate risks associated with resource scarcity and \ngeopolitical trade instability. The global economy is \nfacing increasing supply chain disruptions, particularly \nfor the critical raw materials essential to numerous \nkey industries—including the decarbonisation and \ndigitalisation of the global economy.  \nBusinesses that integrate circular strategies—\nincluding material recovery, closed-loop production, \nand localised supply chains—can reduce reliance \non volatile global markets and potentially cut costs. \nTo maximise these benefits, businesses should \nconsider the bigger picture—such as the indicators \nmeasured in this report—whilst simultaneously \nmeasuring and monitoring circularity for their \nown operations and value chains. Communicating \nprogress and the benefits of adopting circular \npractices can inspire industry-wide adoption, \nbut collaboration is key: by sharing knowledge, \npractising industrial symbiosis, shifting sales \nand service models, and working closely with \ngovernments, businesses can overcome barriers \nand build circular economies of scale.\n15\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nEnsuring human wellbeing while operating within \nthe safe limits of our planet remains the enduring \nchallenge of our time. The economic system should \ndeliver the maximum possible wellbeing to all \nwhile preserving and regenerating the natural \nenvironment and ecosystem services underpinning \nit. The circular economy is a means to this end, \nwith strategies that rethink and optimise how \nwe use resources to provide wellbeing. It can \nprovide the deep cuts in material use needed to \nstave off climate breakdown, bolster biodiversity, \nand boost resilience. Calculating baselines is an \nimportant step to inspire action and inform target \nsetting—essential for creating accountability, \ndriving international cooperation, steering policy \nand re-orienting financial flows. This report aims \nto do just this: building on years of experience \ncalculating the Circularity Metric, it now opens up \nthe Circularity Gap. It recognises that although \nthe Metric has been useful in providing a global \nbaseline for circularity, it is only one piece of \na large and complex puzzle. This year’s edition \nprovides a comprehensive ‘report card’ on the \nstate of the global circular economy. It quantifies \na dashboard of indicators to ground abstract \nconcepts in reality, spark action, pinpoint where \ntargets are missing, and provide a jumping-off \npoint for decision-makers and advisors across \ngovernment and industry to take action.\n1 Introduction\n16\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nWhere we are now and where we’re \nheading\nOver the past eight years of Circularity Gap Reports  \n(CGR®), our opening statements have remained \nmuch the same: relentless growth in global resource \nuse—driven by the continued expansion of global \neconomic activity—is putting Earth’s systems under \nextreme pressure. In 2025, the situation is unchanged. \nThe latest Global Resources Outlook  paints a sobering \npicture of trends in natural resource use, showing that \nglobal material extraction has more than tripled in the \nlast fifty years. We have now surpassed a landmark \nof 100 billion tonnes of material extraction per year. \nThe global population has not grown at the same \nrate, showing that this has only played a partial role \nin spiralling material consumption. Instead, per capita \nconsumption has swelled from 8.4 tonnes in 1970 to \n12.2 tonnes in 2020, fuelled by urbanisation, growing \nGDP and increased affluence. This unfettered growth \nisn’t set to slow—without deep, systematic changes \nto the way the global economy operates, material \nextraction is set to rise by 60% (compared to a 2020 \nbaseline) by 2060.\n11\nAlthough material consumption has been \ninstrumental in raising living standards over the past \ncentury, we’ve now passed the point of diminishing \nreturns in many parts of the world. The current \nscale of global resource use is the main driver of the \ntriple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity \nloss and pollution, with material extraction and \nuse driving around two-thirds of greenhouse gas \nemissions and over 90% of total biodiversity loss \nand water stress, for example.\n12 As of 2023, we’ve \nalso surpassed six of the nine planetary boundaries \nvital to life on this planet.\n13 Business as usual simply \ncannot continue if we’re to achieve global climate, \nbiodiversity, and pollution targets and protect and \npreserve Earth’s life support system.\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nYear\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\nGlobal material extraction (Gt)\nOther biomass\nOther fossil fuels\nOther metal ores\nOther non-metallic minerals\nCrop residues\nCrops\nGrazed biomass and fodder crops\nCoal\nNatural gas\nPetroleum\nCopper ore concentrates and compounds\nGold ore concentrates and compounds\nIron ore concentrates and compounds\nLimestone\nSand gravel and crushed rock for construction\nStructural clays\nCircle Economy - CGR® 2025\nFigure one portrays the evolution of global material extraction from 1970 to 2023 by \nmain material group, as well as the top materials driving this growth.\n17\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nThe widening chasm of resource \ndistribution\nExponential growth in resource consumption hasn’t \nbeen evenly distributed around the globe: high-\nincome countries have a per capita material footprint \nsix times that of lower-income countries—24 tonnes \ncompared to 4 tonnes.\n14 At the same time, high-\nincome countries represent less than one-fifth of \nthe global population, with the EU and US alone \nconsuming more than half the world’s materials \nwhile housing 10% of the world’s population.\n15 Much \nof this material use can be attributed to the build-up \nof infrastructure and capital equipment, as well as \nhigher consumption among citizens in upper-middle \nand high-income countries.\n16 However, beyond a \ncertain point, increasing material consumption \ndoes not necessarily translate to greater well-being: \nmany high-income countries have already reached a \nsaturation point, where further increases in resource \nuse lead to diminishing returns in terms of human \ndevelopment gains (see Figure two). Striking a \nbalance between resource consumption and \nhuman development is crucial.\nAt the same time, material consumption has driven \nenvironmental degradation in countries with fewer \nmeans to mitigate these impacts: per capita, higher-\nincome countries are responsible for ten times the \nclimate impacts of lower-income countries.\n17 Lower-\nincome countries bear the brunt of the consequences, \nwith climate-related natural disasters increasing \neight-fold in the last decade compared to 1980 levels.\n18 \nReducing inequality both between and within nations \nwill be key to tackling the triple planetary crisis: in \nthe process of achieving the estimated ‘sustainable’ \nlevel of consumption—8 tonnes per capita—that has \nserved as a benchmark throughout past Circularity \nGap analyses, higher-income countries will need to \ndrastically reduce their consumption while lower-\nincome countries can increase consumption to build \nup necessary service provisioning (renewable energy \ninfrastructure and sustainable housing, for example).\n19\nFigure two shows the \nrelationship between raw \nmaterial consumption \nper capita (2021) and \nthe Human Development \nIndex (HDI) (2022).\n0\n8\n20\n50\nRaw material consumption per capita (tonnes/capita)\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nHuman development index\nHigh HDI\nVery high HDI\nGSD Target\nCircle Economy - CGR® 2025\n18\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nThe circular economy as a means to \nan end\nThe circular economy, a toolbox of strategies \nand solutions that rethink and optimise how we \nconsume materials, can deliver wellbeing for all while \npreserving the environment and ecosystem services \nthat underpin a functioning economy, including \nclean air, water, natural spaces and biodiversity. \nImagine the circular economy as a way to rewire how \nan economy operates physically: it reduces physical \nthroughputs—and thus environmental impacts—by \noptimising the transformation of resources into \nsocietal needs that contribute to human well-being, \nsuch as housing, mobility and nutrition. \nWe know what the circular economy has to offer: \nthe Circularity Gap Report 2023 found that we can \nreverse the overshoot of planetary limits while \nproviding for similar needs with just 70% of the \nmaterials we use now.\n20 This would mean reducing \nyearly material consumption to around 8.5 tonnes \nper capita, approximately equal to the weight of \ntwo adult elephants, for example. This is roughly \non par with 1970s figures. While this may still seem \nlike quite a lot, it’s important to remember that per \ncapita consumption averages include far more than \nan individual’s yearly purchases and take into account \nthe construction of buildings, infrastructure and \nequipment, just to name a few. \nCrucially, the linear economy wasn’t created by \nchance—it was designed. The activities supporting \nthe unsustainable, linear production and \nconsumption patterns driving the mismanagement \nof natural resources are deeply rooted in our existing \nsystem. To successfully transition to a circular \neconomy, we need to change the rules of the game. \nFundamentally, this requires a shift in behaviours, \nnorms and belief systems, as well as dismantling \nthe tangled web of laws, regulations and policies \nthat allow for—and often incentivise—boundless \nextraction, emissions, and waste. \nStakeholders, including governments and \nbusinesses, have a crucial role to play in \ngenerating momentum for the circular \ntransition and creating the necessary \nmarket conditions for industry to shift \naway from business as usual. This could \nmean levelling the playing field through \nregulations, taxes, and subsidies, as well \nas directly supporting, procuring and \nadvocating for low-carbon, resource-\nefficient energy technologies, circular \nand regenerative farming practices, \nand high-value waste management \ninfrastructure, for example. At the \nsame time, businesses have much to \ngain by not waiting for regulations to \nchange their practices. By proactively \napplying circular economy solutions in \nprocurement, product and service design, \noperations, and waste management, \nbusinesses can mitigate resource risks, \nfrom supply chain disruptions and price \nvolatility to legislative pressure and \nreputational risks.\n21 What’s more, circular \nproducts and services allow businesses to \nincrease brand value, increase customer \nengagement and loyalty, enter new \nmarkets, cut costs and stay ahead of the \ncompetition in terms of innovation.\n19\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nMeasuring the circular economy\nTo deliver on the circular economy’s potential, we \nneed an effective means to measure how materials \nare being used at the global level. This provides \na solid evidence base for local, national and \ninternational changemakers from which to measure \nand monitor progress. Such oversight is crucial in \nrevealing the true extent and impact of material \nmismanagement, helping policymakers pinpoint \nwhere changes are needed most and helping \nindustries set benchmarks and baselines to start \nmonitoring progress. A more detailed, multifaceted \nunderstanding of circularity can bridge gaps between \nhigh-level policies and practical, impactful changes \nacross industries, moving us closer to a sustainable, \ninclusive and regenerative economy. The upcoming \nGlobal Circularity Protocol  for businesses, for \nexample, will play a key role in establishing a shared \nframework for this effort, ensuring consistency \nin how circularity is tracked and compared across \nregions and industries.\nWe cannot recycle our way out of the current linear \neconomy: regardless of how efficiently we use \nmaterials and recycle them at end-of-life, the sheer \nscale of current material extraction is unsupportable \nfor a healthy and safe planet. This underscores the \nneed to first and foremost focus on the absolute \nscales of extracted materials alongside relative \nrates. As long as extraction continues to increase, \nincremental improvements in slowing, regenerating \nand cycling material flows will not be able to offset \nthe significant environmental impacts to come. This \nprinciple is illustrated by the Circularity Metric, which \nhas fallen year on year since Circle Economy first \nbegan measuring, despite gradual increases in the \nscale of secondary material use. \nLooking at rates—like the Circularity Metric—as \nopposed to scales alone gives us insight into how \nquickly resource stocks are depleted and waste is \ngenerated, which signals how quickly environmental \npressures are building. By monitoring how these \nrates change over time, we can identify trends \nin resource efficiency and sufficiency, pinpoint \nopportunities to decouple wellbeing from material \nconsumption and gauge circular progress. This \ndual focus on both absolute figures and relative \nrates is essential to build resilience and shape an \nenvironmentally responsible global economy.\nThe legacy of the global Circularity \nGap Reports: Updating the \ncircularity metric and expanding \nour dashboard of indicators\nThe circular economy agenda has come a long way—\nparticularly regarding monitoring—since the launch \nof our first Circularity Gap Report  in 2018. Our Reports \nhave taken a system-wide perspective to monitor \nand measure the global circular economy. We have \nhistorically reported on the Circularity Metric, which \nmeasures the proportion of secondary material \nconsumption out of total material consumption \nfor an economy. This is an important indicator for \nmeasuring the circular state of an economy. However, \nthis Metric is just one part of a broader picture.\nFor this reason, the Circularity Gap Report 2025 aims \nto provide a comprehensive report on the state \nof the global circular economy , with the view that \nthe Circularity Metric—while important—is only one \npiece of a large and complex puzzle. This report \naims to provide more detail and support practical \ndecision-making by opening up the Circularity ‘Gap’.\nThis report presents and builds on the Circularity \nIndicator Set, a dashboard of 11 indicators \nthat provide a ‘report card’ for global material \ncircularity. Collectively, the Indicator Set examines \nthe relationships between resources we take from \nnature, how we use them, and their impact on the \nenvironment. Represented as shares that add up to \n100% of material inputs and 100% of outputs such \nas waste, emissions, and recycled materials, these \nindicators can be viewed as ‘levers’ to improve the \nCircularity Metric. By reducing indicators that capture \nlinear processes—such as disposing of materials \nwithout recovery or combusting fossil fuels for \nenergy—we have room for the Metric’s share to grow.\nThe Circularity Indicator Set lends itself well to \nintegration with other leading indicator frameworks \nfor the circular economy: the ISO/DIS standard\n22 and \nthe Conference of European Statisticians Guidelines \nfor Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: Conceptual \nFramework, Indicators and Measurement Framework .\n23 \n20\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nThis year, the Circularity Gap Report  provides an \nexpanded report on the state of global circularity.  \nIt builds out the Circularity Indicator Set to \nencompass the beneficial aspects of other leading \nframeworks and provide further context to the \nheadline indicators. These are elaborated upon \nthrough more than 20 other leading indicators—\nglobal statistics on waste collection and recycling, \nenergy consumption and land protection, for \nexample. This can help leaders and decision-\nmakers decide where to focus and enact circular \nsolutions that are in alignment with the ultimate \ngoal of improving wellbeing within environmental \nlimits. The result is a cohesive and comprehensive \nframework suitable for many aims: the headline \nindicators, for example, are helpful for raising \nawareness and communicating circular progress \nat a high level, while lower-tier indicators can \nprovide government officials, policy analysts \nand other more technical stakeholders with the \nin-depth information needed to support decision \nmaking and agenda setting.\nThis analysis has a global scope. However, the \nmeasurement framework can be set up at the  \n(multi- and sub-)national level to account for trade  \nand the movement of materials between nations  \nfor both production and consumption. At the level  \nof businesses and industries, the scope and \nconsequent data collection should be aligned \nto operations and the relevant aspects of the \nsupply chain, whether regional or multinational.\n24 \nThe Circularity Indicator Set can be used as a \nbenchmark and reference if these differences in \nscope are considered during interpretation. \nThis year, the Circularity Gap Report  provides a \nglobal benchmark for circularity on a range of \ndimensions relevant to both governments and \nbusinesses. Through this report, governments \nand businesses can gain an understanding of \nthe global state of circularity and the risks of \ncontinuing along a linear path.\n21\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nThe circular economy is a means for delivering \nwellbeing within planetary boundaries—but \nhow can we take meaningful steps towards \ndismantling entrenched processes and rewire \nthe way we relate to the material world? This \nchapter opens up the Circularity Metric (6.9%) and \nCircularity Gap (the remaining 93.1%), exploring \n11 headline indicators and 23 sub-indicators for \ncircularity. It quantifies how materials flow in \nand out of the global economy and clarifies how \nvarious levers can be pulled to boost circularity. \nThe data reveals a troubling truth: progress is \nunderway in some areas, but negative trends are \noffsetting improvements. Secondary material \nuse, for example, has increased—from 7.1 billion \ntonnes in 2018 to 7.3 billion tonnes in 2021—but \nthe Circularity Metric continues to fall due to rapid \ngrowth in material extraction across the board.  \nAt the same time, the scale of Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials disposed of without \nrecovery has risen: these are materials that could \ncontribute to the Circularity Metric but currently \naren’t. The absolute scale of biomass extraction, \nfossil fuel use and net additions to stocks have \nall risen between 2018 and 2021 despite rates \nremaining relatively stable, underscoring the \ncrucial importance of reducing total material \nthroughput. Although some targets are in place—\ncaps on greenhouse gas emissions and targets for \nland protection, for example—we need concerted \naction from businesses and others to cut material \nuse. Currently, we are not on track to meet a \nsingle indicator explored in this chapter. This \nchapter’s ‘report card’ shows that we have yet to \nget a passing grade. The prognosis is clear: we \nneed strong, science-based targets to generate \ninternational momentum towards a circular \neconomy and sustainable resource use. \n2 A report card for the \nglobal economy\nA comprehensive look into the \nstate of global circularity\n22\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nUnderstanding material flows: How to \ninterpret the Circularity Indicator Set\nExtraction and consumption are growing at almost \nunprecedented levels, but measuring how and where \nthese material flows are directed can give crucial \ninsight into the circular economy’s transformative \npotential. This chapter opens up the Circularity Gap \nand gives insight into the global material budget \nthrough the Circularity Indicator Set, which measures \nCircular material flows  (Secondary Materials \nand Carbon-Neutral Biomass), Linear material \nflows (Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass, Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials, and Fossil Fuels used for \nenergy), and Net stock build-up  (Net Additions to \nStock*). Material flows, whether linear or circular, can \nbe broken down into two ‘cycles’:\n•\n T\nhe technical cycle  relates to the management \nof non-renewable and largely non-biological \nresources that are difficult to reintroduce into \nthe biosphere safely. Examples include concrete, \nplastics and metals, as well as some processed \nbiological materials, such as timber, paper, textiles \nand bioplastics—this is referred to as ‘technical \nbiomass’ throughout this chapter. Materials that \nare part of the technical cycle fall into one of four \ncategories: they become Secondary Materials, \nare Virgin, Non-Renewable Materials destined for \ndisposal without recovery, are added to Stocks, or \nare Fossil Fuels combusted for energy.\n•\n T\nhe ecological cycle  relates to the management \nof renewable, living resources that can cycle in and \nout of the biosphere. It includes biomass used for \nfeed, food or fuel. Materials in the ecological cycle \nare either Carbon-Neutral or Non-Carbon-Neutral \nbiomass. As noted, it’s important to understand \nthat not all biomass stays within the ecological \ncycle, with a portion captured by other indicators.\nFor each indicator, performance is measured on \nboth the input  side—how materials flow into the \neconomy—and the output  side—how these materials \nare processed as waste at their end-of-life. The \nCircularity Metric, for example, is an input-focused \nindicator: it measures the share of secondary \nmaterials flowing into an economy and thus differs \nfrom the global recycling rate, which is an output-\nfocused indicator.\n•\n I\nnput: We start with—and give more relevance \nto—input-side indicators simply because the \nmaterials that enter a system ultimately determine \nwhat comes out. The moment a material leaves the \nenvironment and enters the economy—whether \nextracted from the earth, harvested, or otherwise \nsourced—sets the stage for its entire lifecycle. In a \nmanufacturing facility, for example, the types and \nquantities of raw materials (input) influence the \nquantities of finished products, as well as the waste \nand emissions generated from the production \nprocess. \n•\n O\nutput: Each input-side indicator has a \ncorresponding output. While outputs—like waste, \nemissions and recycled materials—are directly \nlinked to inputs, there’s often a time lag between \nmaterials entering and exiting the system. This is \nbecause materials take different pathways once \nthey enter the economy: some are short-lived —\nlike fuels burnt for energy, fertilisers dissipated \ninto the soil or packaging and consumer goods \nthat are discarded soon after use—and pass \nthrough the system rapidly, becoming outputs \nwithout significant changes in their resource group \ncomposition. Other materials enter the economy \nand become part of Accumulated Stocks —like \nbuildings, infrastructure and vehicles—and remain \nin use for years. Because past and present material \nuse patterns differ in composition, changes \nbetween input- and output-side indicators are \nlargely influenced by the dynamics of stock renewal \nand depletion. Simply put, the materials flowing \nout of the economy today are not shaped just by \nwhat is entering the economy now but largely by \nthe gradual release of materials from Accumulated \nStocks. This highlights the importance of stocks in \ndetermining outputs and, ultimately, the circularity \nof the economy: effective stock management is \ncrucial to maximise circularity and reduce waste \nover time.\n*  The term ‘net’ is important in the context of stock-flow dynamics. \nWe can distinguish three different types of stock accumulation: \nAccumulated Stock, which measures the total volume of materials \nadded to socioeconomic stocks over time; Gross Additions to Stock, \nwhich measures the total amount of materials used in long-lived \napplications (of over one year) in the accounting year . In the context of \nthis analysis, this can include both virgin and secondary materials; and \nNet Additions to Stock, which measures the net amount of materials \nin long-lived applications after accounting for materials removed from \naccumulated stocks through Demolition and Discard in the accounting \nyear . This flow only contains virgin materials, as the amount of \nsecondary materials in both Gross Additions to Stock and Demolition \nand Discard is assumed to be equal within the same accounting year . \nThis report’s analysis measures Net Additions to Stock.\n23\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nOn both the input and output sides, indicators are \nrepresented as percentages that sum to 100%, and \nthus, each represents a fraction of how materials \nenter and leave the economy globally. Values for \neach headline indicator are provided in Table one \nand Table two for 2021, the data year for this report, \nand 2018 to give insight into trends over the last \nyears.

This chapter explores relevant \nsub-indicators for each of the headline indicators \nlisted above, along with insights on their importance \nand guidance on how these indicators can be \ninterpreted and used to track the transition. \nFigure three breaks down the shares of each \ncomponent of the Circularity Indicator Set for \n2021 (the latest available data year), showing \nhow materials enter the economy, are used, and \neventually become outputs.\nCircularity Indicator Set\nof the global economy\nFigure three illustrates the Circularity Indicator Set \nof the global economy using 2021 data.27\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025 25\n\n2.1 Circular \nmaterial flows\nCircular flows refer to materials that flow through the \neconomy in a way that prioritises reuse, recycling, \nand regeneration over virgin extraction and waste \ndisposal. The Circularity Indicator Set differentiates \nbetween two types of circular flows, technical and \necological, corresponding to Secondary Materials  \nand Carbon-Neutral Biomass , respectively.\n2.1.1 Secondary Materials\nSecondary Materials represent the materials collected, \nprocessed and recovered from waste for secondary \nuse in an economy, whether global, national or \nlocal. These can substitute virgin materials, which \nare extracted directly from nature. This indicator is \nquantified on the input and output side:\n11.2%\nof materials flowing out of the \neconomy are…\nWaste destined for recycling. 28 \n(Input) Secondary \nMaterials broken down by \nmaterial group\n6.9%\nof materials flowing into the \neconomy are…\nSecondary Materials—including non-\nmetallic minerals, metals, fossil fuels \nused for material purposes, and technical \nbiomass—both recycled and downcycled. \nThis share represents the portion of \nsecondary materials out of the total \nmaterial input of the global economy, \nwhich includes all primary and secondary \nmaterials.\nThis indicator is referred to as \nthe Circularity Metric. \n26\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nCommentary:\nThe share of Secondary Materials entering the \nglobal economy is low—and steadily falling year \non year, from 7.2% in 2018 to 6.9% as of the latest \navailable data (2021) . This decline is largely due \nto sustained growth in overall material use, which \noutpaces growth in secondary material use. In other \nwords, as long as material consumption keeps rising, \ncompletely closing material loops is incompatible \nwith growth in material throughput. We now know \nthe impact of current and unprecedented levels of \nvirgin material use: high greenhouse gas emissions, \nbiodiversity loss and pollution.\n29 In fact, our Circularity \nGap Report 2021 found that as much as 70% of global \nemissions stem from material handling and use.\n30 This \nhighlights the need to reduce virgin material use while \nincreasing secondary material use—both of which \nwill drive up the Circularity Metric . Achieving this \nwill involve cycling all materials that could be cycled \nbut are not (see page 40) and reducing other linear \nactivities, such as fossil fuel use (see page 44). \nIncreasing circularity is far more complex than \njust increasing material cycling.  While increasing \nsecondary material use as much as possible is \nimportant, there’s a natural limit to how much \nthe Circularity Metric can grow. Even if all waste \ncurrently not being recycled was recycled—without \nreducing overall material throughput—we would only \nreach a Circularity Metric of roughly 25%. This puts \nour conception of ‘circularity’ in perspective: true \ncircularity isn’t about recovering and recycling more,  \nit requires fundamentally restructuring how we \nextract, produce and consume materials. The \nCircularity Gap Report 2021 , for example, found that \nrolling out these deep structural changes across \nkey systems—such as housing, food, and mobility—\nwould reduce material use by approximately one-\nthird—shifting us much closer to a sustainable level \nof material use, estimated at 8 tonnes per capita.\n31 \nThis exemplifies the importance of understanding the \nabsolute scale of virgin and secondary material use, \nalongside rates like the Circularity Metric. \nDesired outcome:\nMaximise the use of secondary \nmaterials by: 1) Systematically reducing \nraw material extraction and overall \nmaterial throughput, 2) Ensuring that \nrecycled and by-product materials \nbecome a more mainstream input across \nall economic sectors, and 3) Prioritising \nthe optimisation of material recovery \nfrom Accumulated Stocks such as \nbuildings and infrastructure.\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nBy breaking down current sources of secondary \nmaterial use, we can better understand \nopportunities for improvement  (see Figure \nfour). Approximately half (49.6%) of the Circularity \nMetric is composed of recycled construction \nand demolition waste —a heavy waste stream \nby mass. The built environment can be seen as a \nhuge repository or ‘bank’ of materials that can be \nrecovered and reused at their end-of-life. However, \nonly 22% of construction and demolition waste \nis recycled, leaving potential for improvement. \nWhat’s more, it’s likely that a significant portion of \n‘secondary’ construction and demolition materials \nis represented by aggregates used for low-value \napplications such as backfilling. Industrial waste —\ncomprising metal scrap, sludges, chemical waste, \noffcuts, and industrial packaging, for example—is \na close second, representing 44% of secondary \nmaterial use. Of all industrial waste generated, \napproximately 41% re-enters the economy. \nMunicipal solid waste —the everyday items we \nuse and then recycle—contributes a much smaller \nportion, at just 3.8% of the total. It should be \nnoted that global municipal solid waste collection \nrates average around 80%, but only 15% of the \ntotal makes its way back into the cycle—indicating \nsignificant potential for improvement. Special \nwastes  like healthcare waste, hazardous waste and \nelectronic waste represent just 2.6%.\nBoosting secondary material use at a macro level \nis a complex challenge. What concrete actions \nare needed to move the needle and ensure more \nmaterials make their way back into the cycle? To \nunderstand and measure progress towards higher \nsecondary material use, it’s important to break \ndown the factors influencing these indicators using \na set of sub-indicators for both material inputs and \noutputs. Table three provides an overview of these \nindicators, their current status, and whether or not \nthey have relevant global or sub-global targets.\nInput:  Virgin material use has a significant impact \non the Circularity Metric. At a global level, it directly \ncorresponds to material extraction , which provides \na snapshot of the volume and type of materials \nextracted from the Earth and signals the extent \nto which economies depend on them. Global \nmaterial extraction\n32 has more than tripled in the \nlast 50 years, reaching 99.8 billion tonnes in 2021 \n(see Figure one). As extraction continues to rise, \nthe ability of secondary materials to meaningfully \nreduce reliance on new extraction is shrinking. \nGlobal secondary material \nconsumption\n93.1%\n6.9%\nCircle Economy - CGR® 2025\nMunicipal solid waste\n3.8%\nIndustrial\nwaste\n44.0%\nSpecial waste\n2.6%\nConstruction &\ndemolition waste\n49.6%\nRaw materials\nSecondary materials\nFigure four illustrates the breakdown of secondary material use—the \nCircularity Metric—on a global scale. \n28\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nOutput: As material use grows, so does waste \ngeneration , totalling 26.4 billion tonnes globally. 33 \nWhile a large part of the materials extracted remain \nwithin the economy for years as Accumulated \nStocks (see page 23), a share becomes ‘output’—in \nthe form of emissions and solid and liquid waste—\nin a relatively short amount of time. Although \nminimising waste generation should be the \npriority, measuring waste as a share of Processed \nOutputs —the materials that leave an economy \nas either emissions or physical waste—gives \ninsight into which portion of these outputs can be \nrecovered and, ideally, recycled. This share stands at \n45.2% globally.\n34 A higher share of waste compared \nto emissions (see page 44) points to a larger pool \nof resources available for recovery. Optimising how \nthese outputs are dealt with—whether they are sent \nto landfill, incineration, or recycling, for example—\nwill be key to minimising the share that actually \nbecomes waste. The relatively high global waste \ncollection rate  (82%) and low global recycling rate  \n(27%\n35) shed light on the effectiveness of recycling \nsystems on a global scale, revealing a significant \ngap between collection and recycling. These figures \nare important to track as waste must be collected, \nsorted, processed and recycled to be transformed \ninto secondary materials, which can then re-enter \nthe economy. However, a portion of collected waste \nis instead directed to controlled or uncontrolled \ndisposal. In countries where waste management \ninfrastructure is still developing, tracking the \ncontrolled disposal rate (globally 15.6%) will be an \nimportant interim step. Strengthening controlled \ndisposal systems can help reduce uncontrolled \nwaste dumping while laying the groundwork for \nexpanding recycling capacity in the future. \nIndicator Value in (year) Trend Global Target Status Sub-Global \nTargets (Y/N)\nGlobal material \nextraction\n(tonnes)\n36\n12.6 tonnes per capita (99.8 \nbillion tonnes) (2021)\n12.3 tonnes per capita (95.0 \nbillion tonnes) (2018)\n8 tonnes per \ncapita per year37 Off-track No\nTotal waste \ngeneration \n(tonnes)\n38\n26.4 billion tonnes (2021)\n26.1 billion tonnes (2018)\nNone n.a.

It does not include certain biomass flows \nlike timber used for building up stock, or packaging \napplications, for example. There are four criteria for \nbiomass to be considered circular, described in depth \non page 32.\n43 Circular biomass must:\n1. M\ninimise environmental impact:  Assess and \nreduce the impact of biomass extraction on \necosystem services.\n2.\n E\nnsure renewability and regeneration: Use \nbiological materials in a way that respects their \nnatural renewal rates and prioritise regenerative \npractices that lead to improved outcomes \n(afforestation and rewilding, for example).\n3.\n C\nascade use: Reuse bio-based products and \ncascade materials before discarding them.\n4. C\nlose the nutrient cycle: Ensure nutrients return \nsafely to the biosphere at their end-of-life. \nMeasuring the circularity of ‘technical’ materials is \neasier than that of biological materials, as they are \nprocessed and reused within industrial systems. \nWhile biological materials do flow into the industrial \nsystem, their circularity broadly relates to how they’re \nreturned to the natural system and the health of the \nbroader ecosystem that they belong to. This is not \nalways concretely defined nor easily measured.\nBecause determining the circularity of biological \nmaterials is conceptually complex and difficult to \nmeasure,\n44 this indicator captures biomass that meets \nthe minimum criterion of carbon neutrality, meaning it \nabsorbs as much carbon during its growth as it emits \nwhen used. This partially addresses the first and last \ncriteria listed above. While some biomass captured \nby this indicator may meet some or even all of the \nremaining criteria, measuring or guaranteeing this \nis not possible due to data limitations. Biomass that \nmeets none of the criteria is measured by another \nindicator: Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass.\nAll biomass that stays within the ecological cycle falls \ninto two categories: carbon-neutral and non-carbon-\nneutral. Carbon-Neutral Biomass meets certain \ncriteria to be considered carbon neutral, while Non-\nCarbon-Neutral Biomass exceeds these limits and is \nconsidered ‘in the red’. This distinction between the \ntwo doesn’t relate to how the biomass is extracted,  \nbut just that a portion is in excess. For more \ninformation on Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass,  \nskip to page 37.\nThis indicator is quantified on the input and  \noutput side:\n21.5%\nof materials flowing into the \neconomy are…\nCarbon-Neutral Biomass. This figure \nquantifies the share of renewable primary \nbiomass inputs in processed materials.\n35.3%\nof materials flowing out of the \neconomy are…\nWaste and emissions from Carbon-\nNeutral Biomass.\n(Input) Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass broken down by \nmaterial group\n30\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nDesired outcome:\nTransition to exclusively using biomass that: \n1) Respects natural cycles—such as the carbon, \nnitrogen and water cycles—and ensures carbon \nneutrality and full nutrient cycling in the right \nplace and at the right pace; 2) Prevents land \ndegradation to preserve and enhance complex, \nbiodiverse ecosystems with healthy soils, and \n3) Maximises its value through cascading where \npossible: reusing it multiple times, through \nmultiple stages, before it is eventually discarded.\n31\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\n4. C lose the nutrient cycle: This means that \nbiological materials can biodegrade and \nsafely return to the biosphere at their end-\nof-life. This involves improving material \nseparability and biodegradability, minimising \nharmful substances in emissions to the \nenvironment and returning nutrients to \nthe ecosystem in a place and at a rate that \nsupports regeneration. ‘In place’ refers \nto the principle that nutrients should be \nreturned to the place in an ecosystem \nwhere they are needed to sustain biological \nprocesses rather than deposited where \nthey could cause harm—for example, \neutrophication in water bodies. ‘At rate’ \nrefers to the principle that nutrient cycling \nshould align with an ecosystem’s natural \nregenerative capacity, being reintroduced \nat a pace that an ecosystem can absorb, \nprocess and use without being disrupted. \nNote that ‘nutrients’ here refer to nitrogen, \nphosphorus, sulphur, carbon and water.\nDue to methodological constraints and current \ndata availability, it is not possible to assess \nall of these criteria. This is why Ecological \nCycling Potential takes carbon neutrality  as a \nminimum criterion, which partially addresses \nthe first and fourth criteria listed in this box. \nThis approach considers land use, land-use \nchange and forestry emissions to determine \nwhich changes in ecosystem carbon stocks \nresult from biomass extraction. This is a \nminimal requirement but an incomplete one: \nconsider, for example, a sustainably managed \nforest where trees are replanted to replace \nthose harvested. These activities may be \ncarbon neutral, but only considering this aspect \ndoes not account for the loss of the ecological \ncomplexity and biodiversity that are hallmarks \nof old-growth forests. Managed forests may \nbe monocultures or have a limited number \nof species, making them less resilient and \nvaluable—even if they’re carbon neutral.\nMeasuring the circularity of biomass \nCurrent circular economy monitoring systems are \nlargely designed to track and interpret technical \ncycles and focus on the reuse of materials within this \nsphere. However, this approach means that it’s difficult \nto monitor and capture circular economy potential \nfully, as the circularity of biomass is not adequately \ncaptured. Biomass is not inherently circular, and the \necological costs of its (over)extraction, from land-use \nchange and the disruption of nutrient cycles to habitat \nand biodiversity loss, can no longer be overlooked. To \nbe fully circular, biomass must:\n1.\n M\ninimise environmental impact:  This means \nassessing and reducing the impact of resource \nextraction on ecosystem services—the benefits \nnature provides to humans, including clean air and \nwater, climate regulation, and natural resources—\nincluding those resulting from land-use change \nand resource depletion. It also involves accounting \nfor the carbon balance by tracking biogenic carbon \nflows—sequestration, storage, and release—and \ntheir impact on the global climate. These flows \ndiffer from fossil carbon in that they cycle through \nthe atmosphere over much shorter timescales.\n2.\n E\nnsure renewability and regeneration:  This \nmeans using biological resources in a way that, at \nthe very least, respects their natural renewal rate, \nprioritising sustainable sourcing to maintain long-\nterm availability. This includes recognising that old, \nwild ecosystems—such as mature forests—provide \nfar greater biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and \necosystem stability compared to new plantations. \nPreserving and sustainably managing natural \necosystems is critical to maintaining these unique \nand irreplaceable benefits.\n3.\n O\nptimise cascading use: This means maximising \nthe value of biological resources 45 by identifying \npathways for their multiple uses and streams, \nensuring resources are reused effectively \nbefore they reach their end-of-life. For example, \nagricultural residues can first be used for materials \nsuch as bioplastics or paper, then as animal \nbedding or compost, and finally for bioenergy. \n32\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nCommentary:\nThere are no established methodologies for \nreliably measuring the circularity of biomass use, \nbut considering the carbon balance of biomass \nuse is a first step . This indicator considers biomass \nthat is carbon neutral as a minimum criterion for \nmeasuring its circularity. While a rate of 21.5% \nmay seem positive, biomass extraction remains \nsynonymous with a number of uncaptured negative \nenvironmental impacts. Because of this, a more \ncircular and sustainable world would not necessarily \nresult in an increase in the rate or scale of Carbon-\nNeutral Biomass extraction. Regardless of whether \nthis indicator grows or shrinks, it’s crucial that all \nmaterials captured by it undergo full nutrient cycling: \nas discussed, this important criterion is not aptly \nreflected. In the future, identifying certification labels \nthat rigorously assess all four criteria—as defined on \npages 30 and 32—could be a practical approach to \ncalculating the share of circular biomass.\nThe scale of biomass extraction is high and a \nkey driver of environmental impacts. Despite its \ndeclining share in global material extraction (from \n41% in 1970 to 26% in 2021), in absolute terms, \nbiomass extraction has more than doubled in the \npast 50 years, increasing from 10.8 billion tonnes \nin 1970 to 26.3 billion tonnes in 2021 (see Figure \nfive). Within this context—and contrary to common \nassumptions—biomass extraction and use is a \nsignificant driver of environmental impacts. It’s among \nthe largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions, \nrepresenting 18% of the total—largely linked to food \nand feed production—while clearing land for crops is \na key driver of habitat destruction and accounts for \nover 90% of land-use-related biodiversity loss.\n46 Many \nof these impacts are driven by global food systems, \nwith food and feed production accounting for 79% \nof the global biomass demand considered under this \nindicator and Non-Carbon-Neutral biomass (see page \n37).\n47 A further 12% is represented by fuel, and 9% is \nrepresented by other uses, such as straw.\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nYear\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\n28\nGlobal biomass extraction (Gt)\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\nShare of biomass in global material extraction\nWood\nGrazed biomass and fodder crops\nCrop residues\nCrops\nCircle Economy - CGR® 2025\nFigure five illustrates the evolution of global biomass extraction and its share of \ntotal material extraction between 1970 and 2021.\n33\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nDeveloping a more sustainable and circular global \neconomy requires transforming land use and \nagriculture.  A disproportionate fraction of global land \nis used intensively, primarily for agricultural purposes \nsuch as pasture and animal feed production:\n48 half \nthe world’s habitable land is used for agriculture, \nwith 80% of this dedicated to livestock. Despite \nthe space required to rear livestock and grow feed \ncrops, livestock provides only a fraction of the global \ncalorie supply.\n49 On a planet with limited space, \nthis inefficiency has significant consequences. \nAs agricultural land continues to expand—often \nencroaching on forests, wetlands and other wild \necosystems—we continue to witness a severe retreat \nof nature. This is the main cause of land use and \nland-use change emissions through deforestation, \nas well as biodiversity loss and soil degradation.\n50 At \nthe same time, we waste about one-third of all food \nproduced, contributing as much as 10% of global \nemissions.\n51 This means valuable land is used for \nfood that never gets consumed—land that could \ninstead contribute to carbon sequestration and \nbiodiversity. To rebalance global land use, we need \nto redesign the food system into a holistic, circular \nand regenerative system that safeguards planetary \nand human health.\n52 Leveraging a sustainable global \nfood system’s full potential requires transforming \nboth production and consumption patterns. This \nincludes minimising synthetic fertilisers that pollute \nsoil and water, prioritising regenerative practices \nlike agroforestry and integrated livestock systems, \nand promoting nourishing diets with more plant-\nbased foods and fewer ultra-processed products.\n53,54  \nThese practices can decrease demand for land and \nother resources, such as water, freeing up space for \nrewilding and reforestation, helping restore damaged \necosystems, expanding global carbon sinks, and \nallowing biodiversity to flourish. It will also build up \nthe resilience of food production and improve food \nsecurity in many countries and regions.\nBuilding a sustainable, circular bioeconomy is \nessential for advancing sustainable resource \nuse, but there is no harmonised methodology \nto measure and monitor it. Measuring the rate of \nCarbon-Neutral Biomass is also important to monitor \nthe sustainability and circularity of the bioeconomy, \nwhich covers all sectors and activities that rely on \nbiological resources (animals, plants, microorganisms \nand derived biomass, including organic waste) and \ntheir ecological functions.\n55 A ‘circular bioeconomy’ \nis an economic model that combines the principles \nof both the circular economy and the bioeconomy \nand aims to optimise the use of renewable biological \nresources while minimising waste and environmental \nimpact through circular practices. \nTo understand and measure progress towards a more \ncircular bioeconomy, it is therefore important to break \ndown the factors influencing these indicators through \na number of sub-indicators. These indicators’ status—\nand whether or not they have relevant global or sub-\nglobal targets—is summarised in Table four.\nInput:  Global biomass extraction  is a key driver of \nenvironmental impacts: its scale is crucial to track. \nIn 2021, this indicator stood at 26.3 billion tonnes, \nequivalent to 3.3 tonnes per capita.\n56 Various biomass \nmaterials and farming practices have different \nassociated impacts: livestock systems, for example, \nhave much higher material, carbon and land footprints \nthan crops cultivated for direct human use.\n57 This \nis why measuring extraction indicators by biomass \ntype and activity  can help indicate where the most \nimpact can be made. Water stress —which measures \nthe share of total human water withdrawals relative to \navailable freshwater resources—provides important \ninsight into the sustainability of biomass production, \nespecially in water-scarce regions.\n58 Globally, water \nstress is 18.6%, but levels vary substantially by region. \nCentral and Southern Asia have high water stress \nlevels—surpassing 75%—while Northern Africa’s water \nstress exceeds 100%, requiring groundwater depletion \nor desalination, for example. In 2020, 2.4 billion people \nlived in water-stressed countries.\n59 Measuring water \nrequirements alongside biomass types and activities \ncan ensure that land use and biomass extraction align \nwith hydrological cycles, allowing water resources \nto be regenerated.\n60 Sustainably optimising biomass \nuse requires regenerative agriculture, better water \nmanagement, and shifting demand away from \nresource-intensive products such as meat and dairy. \nThis is especially important given that agriculture is a \nkey driver of water stress, accounting for 72% of global \nfreshwater withdrawals.\n61\n34\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nAt the same time, positive indicators, such as the \nshare of forested land  (31.1%) (bolstered by land \nprotection rates ), are essential to show where and to \nwhat extent progress is being made. In 2021, forested \nareas (including non-natural forests) represented \nnearly one-third of global land area, down from \n32.5% in 1990.\n62 The average forest area per person \nhas decreased from 1.4 hectares in 1960 to about 0.5 \nhectares as of 2019, reflecting both population growth \nand forest loss.\n63 Similarly, tracking the reclamation \nrate of organic substances  can play a crucial role \nin enhancing the circularity of global biomass inputs \nby ensuring that organic waste—like food scraps, \nagricultural residues, manure, and biodegradable \nproducts—is effectively reintegrated into the \nbiological cycle. This indicator is key for monitoring full \nnutrient cycling, a key criterion for ‘circular’ biomass. \nHowever, no global data on this indicator is available. \nOutput:  On the output side, measuring global \nemissions from land use, land-use change and \nforestry (LULUCF) captures the impact of activities \nlike deforestation, the draining of peatlands, and the \nexpansion of agricultural land, livestock pastures \nand human settlements. These activities deplete \npotential carbon storage and destroy natural habitats, \ndamaging biodiversity. Global net LULUCF emissions \naccount for roughly 2 (between 1.3\n64 and 2.765) billion \ntonnes of CO 2e, or about 5% of total anthropogenic \nemissions, a significant share of which stems from \ndeforestation.\n66 Although carbon sequestration has \nthe potential to offset fossil-based emissions through \nnatural ecological processes, LULUCF currently acts \nas a net source of global emissions. Better land \nmanagement thus holds significant potential to \ncapture and reduce emissions, with preserving and \nregenerating natural carbon sinks essential to limiting \nwarming to 1.5-degrees. Safeguarding and restoring \nnatural ecosystems offers numerous benefits \nin addition to carbon sequestration—bolstering \nbiodiversity, for example. \n35\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nIndicator Value in (year) Trend Global Target Status Sub-Global \nTargets (Y/N)\nGlobal biomass \nextraction \n(tonnes per \ncapita)\n68\n3.3 tonnes per capita (26.3 \nbillion tonnes) (2021)\n3.3 tonnes per capita (25.7 \nbillion tonnes) (2018)\nStable  \n(per capita)\n2 tonnes per \ncapita per year69 Off-track Yes\nWater stress\n(%)\n70\n18.6% (2021)\n18.3% (2018)\nNone n.a.

Properly treated \nwastewater supports nutrient recycling, enabling the \nrecovery of nutrients essential to agriculture: nitrogen \nand phosphorus. This reduces reliance on synthetic \nfertilisers and promotes the circular use of nutrients \nin the biological cycle. Proper wastewater treatment \ncan also contribute to broader environmental goals.  \nFor example, organic matter recovered from \nwastewater can be used to generate biogas or nourish \nsoils while treatment processes prevent the runoff of \nnitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies, where they \ncan cause harm (eutrophication, for example).\n36\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\n2.2 Linear material \nflows\nLinear flows make up the Circularity Gap: they’re \nmaterials that follow a take-make-dispose model \nand aren’t cycled back into either technical or \necological systems. This category comprises three \nindicators: Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass, other \nVirgin, Non-Renewable Materials  (materials that \ncould be recycled but currently are not), and Fossil \nFuels used for energy  (these are combusted into \nthe atmosphere and thus do not have the potential \nfor cycling, making them inherently non-circular).\n2.2.1 Non-Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass\nThis indicator captures the share of virgin Non-\nCarbon-Neutral Biomass—including, for instance, \ncrops on the input side and manure and agricultural \nresidues on the output side—out of total resource \nuse. This means that extracting and using this \nbiomass resulted in net positive emissions due to \nland use and land cover change.\n2.2%\nof materials flowing into the \neconomy are…\nNon-Carbon-Neutral Biomass.  \nThis figure quantifies the share of  \nnon-renewable virgin biomass inputs  \nin processed materials.\n3.4%\nof materials flowing out of the \neconomy are…\nWaste and emissions from Non-Carbon-\nNeutral Biomass.\n(Input) Non-Carbon-\nNeutral Biomass broken \ndown by material group\n37\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nCommentary:\nThis indicator represents biomass that does not \nmeet the minimum criterion of carbon neutrality.  \nThis non-carbon-neutral portion is not linked to a \nspecific source or process but rather represents \nsystemic inefficiencies in biomass extraction. This \nindicator captures the portion of biomass harvested \nat a rate  that cannot be sustainably regenerated or \ntaken from a place  that disrupts natural ecological \nbalances (input) or that is not returned to the \nenvironment ‘in place’ and ‘at rate’ (output). The \npresence of hazardous substances must also be \naccounted for on both the input and output side. This \ncould include chemicals used to harvest or process \nbiomass, for example, as well as the discharge of \ncontaminated biomass into the environment. \nExcessive extraction rates and unsustainable \npractices make biomass a non-renewable, and \nthus linear, resource.  Harvesting biomass at a rate \nthat exceeds its natural capacity for regeneration \nessentially makes it a finite, rather than renewable, \nresource.\n78 If biomass is harvested faster than it can \nregrow or reabsorb the same amount of carbon, it is \nno longer carbon neutral because the total carbon \nstock declines. The same applies to soil, another \nrapidly degrading key renewable resource strongly \nlinked to biomass extraction.\n79 For this reason, \nunderstanding the climate impact of biomass use \nmeans understanding the time-explicit nature of \ncarbon flows: the rate at which carbon is sequestered, \nhow long it’s stored, and how quickly it’s released \nback into the atmosphere.\n80, 81, 82   Non-Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass is that which results in emissions from land \nuse and land-cover change through activities that \ndrive deforestation—particularly in tropical forests\n83 \n—and forest degradation and land conversion for \nagriculture, for example. This could include forest \nbiomass harvesting for large-scale bioenergy \nproduction and practices like shifting cultivation, \nwhere plots of land are temporarily converted for \nagriculture and then abandoned and are unable to be \nfully restored. The drainage and excavation of peat \nfor agricultural purposes also contribute to emissions. \nAlthough peatlands represent just 3% of the world’s \nland area,\n84 they store vast amounts of carbon, and \ndisrupting them releases large volumes of methane, \nthe most potent greenhouse gas.\n85\nDesired outcome:\nEliminate the use of biomass that: \n1) Surpasses the natural rate of \nregeneration or leads to net positive \ncarbon emissions due to land use change, \n2) Disrupts ecological timescales and \nexisting carbon and nutrient balances.\n38\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nAlthough the current share of Non-Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass use is small, it needs to be reduced to \nzero. At just 2.2%, the share of Non-Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass accounts for a small portion of total material \nconsumption. However, Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass \nrepresents approximately one-tenth of total biomass \nuse, a share that is still crucial to minimise. In fact, this \nfigure may also be higher than estimated, as various \nstudies have demonstrated that different accounting \nmethods can significantly affect the share of biomass \nconsidered carbon neutral.\n86, 87  For example, the Kyoto \nProtocol’s guidelines for national accounting—used \nby many countries—have been criticised for allowing \ncountries to adjust forest management definitions \nto their advantage, leading to underreported \nemissions.\n88 As discussed in the Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass section on page 30, carbon neutrality is just \none of many concerns linked to biomass extraction. \nBiomass production can also lead to additional \nenvironmental risks, including disruptions to natural \nnutrient cycles. For example, excessive nitrogen \nand phosphorus can be introduced into agricultural \nsystems, and nutrients from the soil can be depleted \nthrough erosion and runoff. The overuse of non-\nrenewable water resources—where water is taken \nfaster than it can be replenished—is also a significant \nconcern linked to biomass harvesting. Five of nine \nplanetary boundaries have a direct link to the \nbioeconomy,\n89 with biomass extraction linked to the \noverexploitation of forest resources, land use change, \nbiodiversity loss, and increased competition for land \nfrom fuel, feed and food. \nNon-Carbon-Neutral Biomass shares the same sub-\nindicators as Carbon-Neutral Biomass: global biomass \nextraction, biomass types and activities, afforestation \nand land protection rates, ecological overshoot, level \nof water stress, average recycling/reclamation of \norganic substances rates, and proportion of safely \ntreated domestic wastewater flows.\n39\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\n2.2.2 Virgin, Non-Renewable \nMaterials\nThis indicator measures materials that potentially \ncan be cycled but are not. These are heavy mining \nand industrial wastes, products that are short-lived \n(such as paper, packaging, chemicals and some \nconsumer products, including fossil fuels used \nfor material purposes) and longer-lived products \nreaching their end-of-life (such as discarded \nappliances, vehicles, or construction materials). \nProducts and materials captured by this indicator \nwill become waste within the year measured. This \nindicator does not capture fossil fuels used for \nenergy nor biological materials such as food, feed \nand biofuels, but does represent a small fraction of \nunsustainably managed renewable resources, such \nas discarded timber from Accumulated Stocks or \nwood used for short-lived packaging applications.\n18.1%\nof materials flowing into the \neconomy are…\nOther virgin, mostly Non-Renewable \nMaterials, including non-metallic \nminerals, metals, fossil fuels used for \nmaterial purposes, and very small \namounts of technical biomass destined \nfor disposal. Materials in this flow are \nfinite resources extracted from the \nenvironment in the current as well as \nprevious accounting years, and are \ndisposed of without recovery in the \ncurrent accounting year.*\n28.6%\nof materials flowing out of the \neconomy are…\nWaste disposed of without recovery \nwithin the accounting year. This includes \nwaste from both short- and long-lived \napplications in Accumulated Stocks.\n(Input) Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials \nbroken down by material \ngroup\n*  To capture the time lag in stock dynamics in a snapshot of a single \nyear , our framework considers Gross Additions to Stock (on the \ninput side) to be equal to Net Additions to Stock plus demolished and \ndiscarded materials. In this context, Demolition and Discard refers \nto materials extracted from the environment and added to stocks in \nprevious years that become waste in the current year . This approach \nis more useful for circularity measurement than just reporting Gross \nAdditions to Stock on the input side, as it allows us to better understand \nthis portion of inflows from a circularity perspective.\n40\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nCommentary:\nThis indicator reveals significant potential to \nbolster Secondary Material use.  This indicator can  \nbe interpreted as the antithesis of the Circularity \nMetric: it includes everything that could  be \ncontributing to Secondary Material use but isn’t. At \n18.1% and 28.6%, the input and output rates of Virgin, \nNon-Renewable Materials reveal substantial room for \nincreasing global circularity. Ideally, the rate of this \nindicator would fall as close to zero as possible, with \nthese materials instead contributing to Secondary \nMaterial use. The absolute scale of Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials should also drop: this indicator \ngrew from approximately 17.9 billion tonnes in 2018 \nto 19.2 billion tonnes in 2021. Reducing this indicator \non the input side will require cutting consumption to \nprevent difficult-to-manage wastes in the first place, \nalongside circular design strategies that minimise \nwaste generation and allow for material recovery. On \nthe output side, the emphasis should be on increasing \nhigh-value applications for waste and improving \nwaste management infrastructure. For example, when \ndealing with construction waste, disassembly and \nreuse are preferable to recycling and highly preferable \nto backfilling, a low-value application. However, a \nlarge portion of materials captured by this indicator \nare heavy, lower-value waste streams—soils, for \nexample—without higher-value applications. \nThis indicator primarily reflects heavy, hard-to-\nrecycle waste, underscoring the importance of \ncircular strategies that minimise waste from the \noutset.  HWhile we don’t have a granular breakdown \nof the materials and products captured by this \nindicator, we can see that a majority on the input \nside is represented by construction minerals (53%), \nwith metal ores (33%), industrial minerals (5%), fossil \nfuels (6%)\n90 and biomass (3%) contributing smaller \nshares. While a portion of the 86% represented by \nconstruction minerals and metal ores could be waste \nfrom construction and demolition—a very heavy \nwaste stream by weight—the bulk of it likely comprises \nwaste from used and unused extraction from mining \nand quarrying, for example, including waste rock, \ntailings and soils.\n91 Much of this wouldn’t be suitable \nfor high-value recycling, and options to repurpose \nthese materials are limited, often depending on \nmaterial composition and economic feasibility.  \nDesired outcome:\nMinimise all non-renewable material \nflows and transform how materials are \nmanaged throughout their lifecycle \nby: 1) Prioritising circular strategies that \ndesign out waste and reducing waste \nfrom extraction as much as possible, 2) \nRecovering the highest value materials \nfrom products at their end-of-life, 3) \nEliminating the need for and providing \nalternatives to fossil-based feedstocks, \nand 4) Improving collection and recycling \nsystems for all recyclable materials.\n41\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nControlled\ndisposal\nRecycled\nUncontrolled\ndisposal\n2%\n3%\n5%\n6%\n27%\n2%\n5%\n18%\n32%\nRecycled\nUncollected\nControlled \nlandﬁll\nIncineration\nOther\nUnspeciﬁed\nlandﬁll\nUnaccounted\nOpen dump\nSanitary \nlandﬁll\nCircle Economy - CGR® 2025\nlandfills—alongside other damaging waste streams \nlike medical and e-waste—will still have an important \nrole to play in boosting circularity and improving \nother environmental outcomes. Landfilling remains \na persistent social and environmental challenge, \nwith uncontrolled disposal—representing 57% of \nglobal waste treatment (see Figure six)—causing \nuncontained negative impacts, such as pollution from \nleachate and harmful gases, health hazards and land \ndegradation. These landfills also incur financial costs \nthat often impact local communities. While controlled \nlandfills are better than uncontrolled dumpsites, they \nare still not ideal: they cause environmental, social \nand health impacts and potentially lock away valuable \nresources, making them unavailable for cycling.\n93  \nA shift towards higher-value waste management will \nbe crucial in reducing this indicator’s share, which  \ncan be driven by suitable infrastructure and \nlegislation, including landfill diversion targets, taxes \nand bans—all of which have had success at reducing \nlandfilling rates in the EU.\n94 However, their success \nhinges on the availability of fit-for-purpose waste \nprocessing infrastructure and technology for plastics, \ntextiles and organic waste, for example.\nWaste rock can be crushed and used as aggregate \nfor various construction projects, while tailings \ncan sometimes be used to produce brick and tile. \nHowever, many mining byproducts can contain heavy \nmetals or hazardous substances that make them \ndifficult to cycle without extensive treatment, which \nis costly and poses additional environmental risks. \nThis underscores the importance of reducing material \ndemand and improving processes to reduce the \ngeneration of these hard-to-manage wastes in the \nfirst place.\nWhile heavy waste streams do make up the \nmajority of Virgin, Non-Renewable Materials, \nthis should not overshadow the importance of \nbetter managing smaller waste streams, such as \nmunicipal solid waste . It’s estimated that the world \ngenerates more than 2 billion tonnes of municipal \nsolid waste yearly—a figure set to increase by 70% by \n2050.\n92 In many parts of the world, the informal sector \nplays a vital role in municipal waste management, \nthough this often means that these activities aren’t \nproperly captured by official statistics nor recognised \nand supported by waste management policy. \nBetter managing this waste and diverting it from \nFigure six provides a breakdown \nof global waste treatment.\n42\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nBeing tied to the Circularity Metric, this indicator \nshares its sub-indicators: total material extraction, \ntotal waste generation, waste as a share of  \nProcessed Outputs, the global waste collection rate, \nthe global recycling rate, and the controlled disposal \nrate. As material extraction decreases and global \nwaste collection and recycling rise, the share of Virgin,  \nNon-Renewable Materials will fall; tracking these \nindicators thus gives insight into the factors \nunderpinning current rates and scales of  \nnon-renewable inputs.\n43\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\n2.2.3 Fossil Fuels\nThis indicator represents fossil-based energy \ncarriers—such as those derived from petroleum, oil \nshale and tar sands, coal, and natural gas—burnt \nfor energy. These flows are inherently non-circular: \nas they are combusted, they release greenhouse \ngas emissions into the atmosphere. Once released, \nthese emissions are almost impossible to recapture \nor reuse at the speed, scope and scale necessary to \nlimit warming to 1.5-degrees.\n95\n13.3%\nof materials flowing into the \neconomy are…\nFossil Fuels used for energy purposes.\n21.6%\nof materials flowing out of the \neconomy are…\nEmissions and waste from Fossil Fuels \nused for energy purposes.\n(Input) Fossil Fuels \nbroken down by material \ngroup\n44\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nCommentary:\nAs a key contributor to climate change and other \nenvironmental impacts, fossil fuels are one of the \nmost impactful material groups (see Figure seven). \nThis mirrors global economic growth, with the two \nhaving a tight historical relationship. Fossil fuels are \nalso the most traded natural resource, accounting for \naround half of traded materials globally in 2020.\n96  \nAs fossil fuels remain the dominant energy source \ntoday, the scale of fossil fuel use poses a risk to \nplanetary health.\n97 Their applications are vast: coal is \nused for power generation and processing materials \nsuch as metals and chemicals, oil primarily powers \ntransport, and natural gas is used for electricity \ngeneration, heat, and as chemical feedstock.  \nWithout systematically restructuring how we \npower transport, generate electricity and process \nmaterials—in addition to scaling down these \nactivities—fossil fuel demand is set to grow. \nRising global energy demand is driving fossil fuel \ndependence—but the circular economy transition \ncan support a sustainable, responsible energy \ntransition.  Global economic growth and energy \ndemand have historically been closely coupled, with \nenergy demand increasing by 1 to 2% per year. This \ngrowth can partially be attributed to population \ngrowth, but it is also driven by a rise in average energy \nuse per capita. For example, global average energy \nuse per person increased from 1.55–1.65 tonnes of \noil equivalent in 2000 to 1.78–1.80 tonnes in 2021.\n98 \nWithout making systemic improvements in efficiency, \ntotal energy consumption will continue to grow—\nmaking the shift from fossil fuels to a low-carbon \nenergy system even more difficult, as new renewable \nenergy will have to both replace existing fossil fuel \ncapacity and meet additional energy needs. At the \nsame time, the circular economy itself will require \nsignificant energy inputs, from reverse logistics to \nrecycling and material recovery technologies. This \nunderscores the importance of minimising energy \ndemand and bolstering systemic efficiency while \nensuring that energy is generated through clean, \nrenewable sources.  \nDesired outcome:\nInitiate a managed transition away \nfrom fossil fuel use for energy by: 1) \nPrioritising improvements in systemic \nefficiency and 2) Transitioning to an \nenergy system that’s electrified where \npossible and based on renewables.\n45\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nDecarbonisation is part of a more global circular \neconomy: resource-light and low-carbon economies \ngo hand in hand.  The current fossil-based energy \nsystem is inherently material-intensive and linear, \nrequiring a constant flow of carbon-intensive fossil \nfuels to sustain it. At the same time, developing \nrenewable energy systems will also be initially \nmaterial-intensive, especially metals and critical \nminerals. Many of these materials have high supply \nrisks and environmental and social costs. Circular \neconomy strategies can help scale renewable energy \nsustainably by reducing its environmental footprint—\nminimising both the resource extraction required \nand other environmental impacts of cutting carbon \nemissions.\n102 A circular economy approach that \nmaximises systemic efficiency in the energy system \nand follows circular design principles at the product, \nasset and system levels is essential to reduce both \nfossil fuel reliance and minimise the raw material \nfootprint of the energy transition.\n103\nCircular economy principles should be at the \nfoundation of the energy transition to achieve \nsustainable resource management.  The energy \ntransition is a physical transformation and is, \ntherefore, material-intensive. Building a low-carbon \neconomy will require a cumulative scale-up of \nmaterial extraction, particularly metals.\n99 The energy \ntransition will result in a surge in demand for critical \nraw materials like lithium, cobalt, and rare earth \nelements—resources concentrated in a few countries, \ncreating new dependencies and supply risks.\n100 A \ncircular economy approach is crucial to reducing \nreliance on sensitive supply chains, enhancing \nresource security, and building resilience against price \nvolatility and supply shortages—supporting a more \nsustainable and responsible energy transition.\n101\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nYear\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\nGlobal fossil fuel extraction (Gt)\n0%\n10%\n20%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nNatural gas\nPetroleum\nCoal\nCircle Economy\nCGR® 2025\nShare of fossil fuels in global material extraction\nOil shale and tar sands\nFigure seven illustrates the evolution of global fossil fuel extraction and its share \nof total material extraction between 1970 and 2021.\n46\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nthrough a number of sub-indicators. These indicators’ \nstatus—and whether or not they have relevant global \nor sub-global targets—are summarised in Table five.\nInput: On the input side, a number of sub-\nindicators give insight into the structural factors \nthat currently contribute to the global material \nfootprint of fossil fuel-based energy carriers. We \nknow that transitioning to a decarbonised energy \nsystem is key to reducing fossil fuel dependence \nand mitigating climate change. This process has a \nfew key components, measured by three indicators. \nUltimately, we need to:\n1) Optimise the energy system to help reduce total \nprimary energy supply,  which stands at about \n579–597 exajoules\n105 (or 13.8–14.3 billion tonnes of oil \nequivalent), with 82% coming from fossil fuels in 2021. \nImproving systemic efficiency in energy-intensive \nsectors, such as mobility, manufacturing and heating, \nwill reduce both end-use energy demand and material \nuse. Within the current system, improving systemic \nefficiency can be incredibly effective: analysis shows \nthat global energy demand in 2050 could be up to \n40% lower than today if all possible efficiencies are \nimplemented.\n106 \nRealigning financial incentives to support circular \nand low-carbon solutions is important for reducing \nglobal fossil fuel demand and accelerating the \ntransition to sustainable energy systems.  High \nsubsidies and other financial incentives can reinforce \nglobal dependence and slow the shift to circular, low-\ncarbon alternatives. Redirection of financial flows will \nbe needed to help the scaling down of fossil fuels. In \n2021, explicit subsidies—such as the direct transfer \nof government funds, price support, and other \nforgone tax revenue—represented an estimated \nUS$1.4 trillion (about 0.94% of global GDP).\n104 \nReorienting financial flows from subsidies towards \ndecarbonisation—through a systemically efficient \nenergy system based on electrification and powered \nby abundant renewables—will be necessary to reduce \nfossil fuel demand, mitigate environmental impacts \nand optimise long-term resource use.\nUltimately, the global economy should aim to  \nreduce the rate of fossil fuel consumption while  \nalso minimising the scale of these materials used.  \nTo understand and measure progress towards \nreducing fossil fuel usage, it’s important to break \ndown the factors influencing these indicators  \nIndicator Value in (year) Trend Global Target Status Sub-Global \nTargets (Y/N)\nTotal primary energy \nsupply (exajoules)\n579\n111–597112  \nexajoules (2021)\n570113–581114  \nexajoules (2018)\n464.5 exajoules \n(2030),\n553.2 exajoules \n(2050)115 \nOff-track Yes\nShare of final energy \nconsumption from \nrenewable sources (%)\n116\n18.7% (2021) \n17.3% (2018)\n50–60%117 Off-track Yes\nShare of electricity in  \ntotal global energy  \nconsumption (%) 118, 119\n20.1% (2021)\n19.5% (2018)\nNone n.a.

Because electricity (from renewable \nenergy technologies) requires less primary energy \nsupply to generate, electrifying as many activities as \npossible—from transportation (think small electric \nvehicles) to building heating (through heat pumps, \nfor example) and steel production (through green \nhydrogen)—will be crucial for decreasing fossil fuel \ndependence.\n107 Electrification is increasing, but at \na slower rate than overall energy demand, while \nthe carbon intensity of electricity generation keeps \ngrowing, not decreasing.\n108\n3) Systemically optimise and scale up decarbonised \nelectrification across industries to rapidly increase \nthe share of total final energy consumption from \nrenewable sources  (18.7% in 2021, up from 17.3% \nin 2018).\n109 This is important because, so far, new \nrenewable energy has overall supplemented  not \nreplaced  existing fossil-based energy capacity.\nOutput:  On the output side, indicators capture the \nenvironmental impact of fossil fuel consumption, \ngiving insight into the consequences of using these \nmaterials. Global anthropogenic greenhouse \ngas emissions (excluding emissions from LULUCF) \ntotalled 53 billion tonnes of CO\n2e in 2021, with fossil \nfuel combustion as the primary driver: 72% of this \nstems from energy use. This underscores the urgent \nneed to transition away from fossil fuels to curb \nclimate change. Measuring emissions as a share \nof Processed Outputs —the materials that leave an \neconomy as either emissions or physical waste—\ngives insight into fossil fuel dependence, with a high \nshare indicating that an economy depends heavily \non emissions-intensive activities. Of the total output \nproduced by the global economy, over half (54.8%)\n110 \nis emissions. Unlike solid waste, which can often \nbe recovered and recycled, capturing emissions for \nreuse is not yet feasible at scale. This limits the pool \nof waste available for circular recovery, reducing \nopportunities for reuse and recycling. This indicator \nvaries by region: industrialised regions like North \nAmerica (65%), Europe (61%) and Asia & Oceania (53%) \nhave higher shares, while Latin America (32%) and \nAfrica (21%) have significantly lower shares.\n48\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\n2.3 Stock build-up\nThis category includes a single indicator that \nmeasures the share of virgin material flows \nbeing added to global stocks—such as buildings, \ninfrastructure, machinery, and vehicles—in net \nterms. Stock build-up refers to the input and \naccumulation of materials within an economy over \ntime—crucial for understanding the long-term \ndynamics of material use and its implications for \nsustainability and resource management. These \nadditions to stocks are not inherently good or bad. \nThey can be necessary to meet societal needs like \nhousing and transportation. However, they are also \nsignificant drivers of material use, contributing \nto the high level of resource consumption that \nlimits circularity. While materials captured by this \nindicator may have circular ‘potential’, considering \nthe time element is also important here. These \nmaterials are locked into long-lived assets and \nunavailable as secondary material inputs for many \nyears or even decades, and this delay creates a \ntemporal gap or ‘lag’ in circularity. For this reason, \nstrategies that optimise stock build-up, extend the \nlifetimes of existing assets, and enhance future \nmaterial recovery are crucial for improving circular \nflows over time.\nWhile this indicator captures net stock additions—\nthe difference between inflows and outflows—\nthis dynamic is also influenced by reuse, \nremanufacturing, or repurposing taking place \n‘within’ stocks. Many products are recirculated  \nbut not recycled: they aren’t classified as Secondary \nMaterials and captured by the Circularity Metric. \nExamples include second-hand electronics and \nfurniture reused on a smaller scale or asphalt  \nor vehicles on a larger scale. While this indicator  \ndoes not capture the scale at which reuse and  \nother R-strategies take place, we can broadly \nassume that these strategies will lessen demand for \nnew stock build-up,\n123 thus optimising Net Additions \nto Stock.\n2.3.1 Net Additions to Stock\nNet Additions to Stock measures the rate of \nphysical growth in an economy’s material \naccumulation. This indicator represents the \ndifference between the virgin materials* added \nto the accumulated physical stock and those \nremoved over a given period of time, usually \nupwards of one year. Unlike material flows—which \ntrack how materials move  through the economy—\nstocks represent materials that accumulate  in the \neconomy. As economies develop, material flows \ncontribute to material stocks—a relationship that \nshapes future resource demand for maintenance \nand replacement and influences future waste \ngeneration and management. Both flows and \nstocks should be examined to understand how \nmaterials are extracted, processed, accumulated \nand ultimately either lost or cycled. \n38.0%\nof materials flowing into the \neconomy are…\nNet additions of virgin materials—largely \nnon-metallic minerals and metals, but \nalso small amounts of fossil fuels used \nfor material purposes and technical \nbiomass—accumulated in stocks.\nNet Additions to Stock \nbroken down by material \ngroup\n*  While a large portion of secondary materials is used in long-lived \napplications and contributes to Gross Additions to Stocks, the net \naccumulation shown by the Net Additions to Stock indicator does \nnot include secondary materials. In a static EW-MFA accounting \nframework, the amount of secondary materials entering (in Gross \nAdditions to Stock) and recyclable waste leaving (in the Demolition \nand Discard flow) from Accumulated Stocks will always be the same. \nIn this framework, all secondary materials and recyclable waste—\nwhether used in long-lived or short-lived applications—are recorded \nby the inflows and outflows of Secondary Materials. \n49\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nCommentary:\nStock build-up plays a crucial role in shaping global \nmaterial flows, waste generation, and emissions, \nacting as both a driver of and a constraint on \ncircularity. Net Additions to Stock represent a \nsignificant portion of global material use, with \napproximately 38% of materials entering the economy \nremaining in use for an extended period. However, \nthis indicator doesn’t capture the materials required to \noperate Accumulated Stocks. When those are included, \nthis figure increases to more than 70%, highlighting \njust how many materials are used to construct, \nmaintain and operate them. The rate of stock \ngrowth—recorded by Net Additions to Stock—has \ngrown spectacularly, causing Accumulated Stocks to \nincrease 23-fold over the 20th century and to roughly \ndouble every two decades.\n124 The scale and pace of \nthis build-up have profound implications for resource \nefficiency, emissions, and waste management. While \ngrowing material stocks contribute to economic \ndevelopment and improved living standards, they \nmay also increase long-term resource dependency \nand pose challenges for future material circularity. \nThis is because poorly designed stock—an energy-\ninefficient building that requires natural gas to heat, \nfor example—increases the long-term material \nrequirement related to it. On the other hand, long-\nlived assets designed with circular principles—a \nmodular, timber-based, energy-efficient building \nwith solar panels and a heat pump, for example—can \nreduce long-term material dependency.\nThe combination of rapid urbanisation and \neconomic growth is driving the increasing \naccumulation of stock worldwide.\n125 The amount \nof built-up land is a key driver of per capita material \ndemand, as expanding infrastructure and urban areas \nrequire substantial resource inputs.\n126 Urbanisation \nis accelerating, with the share of people living in \ncities growing from 47% in 2000 to 56% in 2021.\n127 \nProjections suggest this could reach 68% by 2050, 128 \nadding 2.5 billion more people to urban areas. \nSignificant stock additions in cities will be necessary to \naccommodate this growth and to provide decent living \nconditions for the one-third of urban residents who \ncurrently live in slums and informal settlements, often \nwithout access to basic services. Going forward, it will \nbe crucial to balance the provision of essential services \nwith optimised material use and the integration of \ncircular principles. \nDesired outcome:\nOptimise material accumulation in \nstocks by: 1) Maximising the use and \nadaptation of existing physical assets, \nsuch as buildings, infrastructure, \nand machinery, instead of building/\nproducing new, 2) Increasing the share \nof sustainably-managed renewable \nmaterials in stock composition, and 3) \nPrioritising circular design principles—\nsuch as design for durability, repairability, \ndisassembly and recyclability—in new \nstock additions.\n50\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\n3 billion tonnes, for example. 132 Projections indicate \ncontinued stock expansion: for example, residential \nbuilding stock is projected to grow by 50% by 2050, \nwhile the global service-related building stock is \nprojected to increase by 150%.\n133\nWhile stock build-up has become a key driver \nof global resource use, a single global indicator \noverlooks significant differences between regions \nand countries. Upper-middle and especially high-\nincome countries have historically built up their \nstock,\n134 while lower-income countries are still \ndeveloping stock to meet their residents’ societal \nneeds. Total floor space is expected to grow by 97 \nbillion square metres between 2022 and 2030, with \nthe bulk of this notable increase likely to be driven \nby lower- and middle-income countries.\n135 This \nunderscores the need for sustainable practices in \nconstruction and resource management to mitigate \nthe environmental impacts associated with this \ngrowth: Lower-income countries should develop stock \nin line with circular principles that maximise resource \nefficiency—such as prioritising secondary and low-\ncarbon materials and designing for durability, reuse \nand disassembly at end-of-life—and sustainably \noptimise and manage stock expansion.\n136 At the \nsame time, the current weight of per capita stocks is \nhigher in industrialised countries than in developing \ncountries:\n137 residents of high-income nations \nconsume significantly more materials than those in \nlow-income nations, regardless of urbanisation levels. \nFor this reason, higher-income, stock-rich countries \nshould aim to minimise new stock growth, prioritise \nrenovation and adaptation over building new, \nmaximise the intensity of building use, and maximise \nmaterial efficiency for long-lasting manufactured \ngoods, for example. Durable, repairable, and modular \ndesign approaches can significantly extend the \nusability of these assets. \nEmbedding circular economy principles into urban \nplanning and development will be key to reducing \nglobal resource use and achieving a more circular \neconomy. As urban areas grow, so too does stock \nbuild-up, thus locking in materials for decades, \nshaping material demand patterns and slowing the \nrate at which these resources can re-enter the system \nthrough reuse or recycling. Without strategies to \noptimise urban planning and stock build-up—such as \nlocalised operations, material-efficient construction, \nadaptive reuse, and designing for longevity—cities \nrisk becoming long-term hotspots of growing material \ndemand, exacerbating resource depletion and \nenvironmental pressures. By 2050, urban material \nconsumption is projected to grow by 150%, from 40 \nbillion tonnes in 2010 to 90 billion tonnes.\n129 However, \ndesigning compact, resource-efficient cities based on \ncircular economy principles could cut greenhouse gas \nemissions by 36–56% while also lowering demand for \nmetals, land, energy and water.\n130 At the same time, \nactively ‘mining’ materials from Accumulated Stocks—\ninstead of the natural environment—provides another \nkey opportunity to boost circularity by increasing the \npool of secondary materials available.\nThe sheer scale of non-metallic mineral use—driven \nby stock build-up—has fuelled the unprecedented \naccumulation of human-made materials. While all \nmaterial groups are linked to stock build-up, non-\nmetallic minerals make up the largest portion. This \nis in part due to their substantial weight: the sand \nand limestone used to produce cement and gravel \nused to build roads and fill construction sites, for \nexample. Non-metallic mineral extraction has grown \nexponentially in past decades, from 8.5 billion tonnes \nin 1970 to 47.9 billion tonnes in 2021 (see Figure one). \nThis is a key reason why, in 2020, humanity reached a \nnew milestone when the mass of human-made things \nsurpassed that of all living things on Earth—plants, \nanimals and humans.\n131 The weight of Accumulated \nStocks on Earth has also significantly increased over \nthe past decades, estimated at over 1 trillion tonnes \nin 2016. The majority of these materials are found in \nroads (313 billion tonnes), residential buildings (290 \nbillion tonnes), civil engineering (243 billion tonnes) \nand non-residential buildings (234 billion tonnes). \nMachinery and other shorter-lived products contribute \nfar less, with the weight of motor vehicles totalling just \n51\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nSetting a specific goal for the share of Net \nAdditions to Stock is complicated, as this will vary \nsignificantly by context. For example, a country’s \ntarget for a given year would depend on historic stock \nbuild-up, how current Accumulated Stock is being \nmanaged, and how needs for new stock additions \nare being met. It’s more important that the materials \ncaptured by this indicator are sustainably optimised so \nthat the full potential for circularity can be met. Stock \nbuild-up is measured using input-side sub-indicators, \nas inputs inherently account for both outputs and net \naccumulation. However, stock dynamics introduce \na significant time lag because materials entering \nthe system today do not immediately translate into \noutputs. Many of these materials become part of \nlong-lived assets—such as buildings, infrastructure, \nand vehicles—remaining in use for years or decades. \nOver time, these materials gradually exit the economy, \nshaping output-side indicators. This means that \ncurrent outputs are largely influenced by past inflows \nrather than present material use. Resources that leave \nthe system as outputs are classified under different \nindicators: either waste destined for recycling or waste \ndisposed of without recovery (see Figure three).\nThese indicators’ status—and whether or not they \nhave relevant global or sub-global targets—is \nsummarised in Table six.\nInput: Input-side sub-indicators for Net Additions to \nStock give insight into the flows of materials included \nin societies’ physical stocks, as well as their longevity. \nThe global growth rate in built-up areas —an \nincrease of 33% between 2000 and 2022—reveals \nthe rising material demand for new buildings, \ninfrastructure, and transport systems.\n138 This is \nparticularly noticeable in rapidly developing regions \nwhere built-up areas in Asia or Africa have grown \n40% over the past two decades, compared to 20% for \nEurope and North America. Measuring the share of \nrenewable biomass out of Net Additions to Stock \n(0.4%) helps track progress towards a bioeconomy. \nMost of this progress, at least from a mass \nperspective, will relate to changes in the composition \nof stocks as opposed to other (still important) \napplications such as biorefinery products. However, \nto achieve this, we need to respect the principles \nof a circular bioeconomy, as explored on page 34: \nminimising carbon emissions and cycling nutrients \nback into the ecosystem at the right place and rate. \nAdditionally, optimising the average lifetimes of \nasset categories —such as residential buildings, \nvehicles, and appliances (see Figure eight)—provides \ninsight into their durability and replacement cycles. \nThis directly influences the rate at which new materials \nare needed. By slowing material turnover, we can \nminimise resource demand in the long term. \n52\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nGlobal stock optimisation\nLegend\nAppliancesVehicles Residential \nbuildings\nAsia and Oceania\nLatin America\n87\n 10.5\n83\n75\n72\n54\n50\n44\n8.3\n9.1\n9.2\n7.2\n7.0\n16\n15\n14\n17\n21\n17\n17\nEurope\nGlobal average North America\nAfrica\nLifetime of selected assets compared to the \nglobal average\nOECD mixed\nIncludes: Australia, Switzerland, \nChile, Island, Israel, South Korea, \nNorway, Mexico, New Zealand \nand Turkey\nThis visual is built using data from different sources and with \ndifferent reference years ranging between 2007 and 2015.\nUnit: years\n9.0\nFigure eight illustrates the lifetimes of three asset \ncategories across world regions.\n53\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nIndicator Value in (year) Trend Global Target Status Sub-Global \nTargets (Y/N)\nGrowth rate in global \nbuilt-up area (%) 139\n+ 33%  \n(2000–2020) None n.a.

The Circularity Metric is too low, and our \nuse of Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass, Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials, and Fossil Fuels is too high, but \nestimating appropriate rates for some indicators—\nsuch as Carbon-Neutral Biomass and Net Additions \nto Stock—is complex. Table seven demonstrates \nthe results of a thought experiment using key \nglobal targets to reimagine the distribution of the \nCircularity Indicator Set in a more sustainable and \ncircular world. It’s assumed that:\n•\n T\nhe Circularity Metric increases to 17% by 2032; 144\n• V irgin material use is capped at the estimated \nsustainable level of 8 tonnes per capita 145—close to \nthe level of consumption in 1970—for a projected \npopulation for 2032; 146 \n•\n E\nmissions are reduced by 25 billion tonnes of CO 2e \nby 2030, to stay below 1.5-degrees of warming; 147\n• B iomass consumption is reduced by 75% by 2050 \n(compared to 2020 levels), 148 compatible with a cap \non bio-based material consumption at 2 tonnes per \ncapita.\n149\nCrucially, the absolute volume of material throughput \nmust decrease. As shown in Table seven below, \napplying these targets results in a significant \nreduction in the scales of each indicator. This \nhighlights the importance of considering overall \nscales , at the very least, in conjunction with—if \nnot instead of—rates. In this scenario, for example, \nthe rate of Carbon-Neutral Biomass—a potentially \n‘circular’ indicator—falls simply because less \nmaterials are being used overall.\n2021 2032\nRate (%) Scale (billion \ntonnes) Rate (%) Scale (billion \ntonnes)\nSecondary Materials/Circularity Metric \n(Input Technical Cycling) 6.9% 7.3 17.0% 14.3\nCarbon-Neutral Biomass (Input Ecological \nCycling Potential) 21.5% 22.8 20.4% 17.1\nNon-Carbon-Neutral Biomass (Input Non-\nRenewable Biomass) 2.2% 2.3 0.0% 0.0\nOther Virgin, Non-Renewable Materials \n(Input Non-Renewable Flows) 18.0% 19.2 14.4% 12.1\nFossil Fuels used for energy purposes \n(Input Non-Circular Flows) 13.3% 14.1 6.9% 5.8\nNet Additions to Stock 38.0% 40.3 41.2% 34.6\nTotal 100% 106.1 100% 83.9\nTable seven presents the results of a thought experiment, illustrating how achieving various global sustainability targets could \nimpact the distribution of the Circularity Indicator Set and, more crucially, the scale of material throughput.\n55\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nCircular economy metrics for \nbusinesses\nWhile governments define regulatory frameworks \nwithin their jurisdictions, businesses—by operating \nglobal value chains—directly shape the actual \nperformance of global resource flows. This is why a \ngrowing number of businesses are measuring and \nreporting on the circular economy performance of \ntheir own operations and value chains. A growing \nnumber of measurement frameworks and reporting \nstandards\n150 are making it easier for businesses \nto report on such matters using language and \nindicators that are well-understood and defined. \nWhile the indicators explored throughout this \nchapter are macro-level and perhaps better \nsuited to national or regional governments, the \nimportance of businesses in driving the circular \ntransition should also be recognised. \nMeasuring the circularity of global resource  \nflows requires a very different set of indicators \nthan measuring the circular economy performance \nof individual actors—like businesses—that are \nengaged with those resource flows. Businesses  \ncan set out to measure the performance of \nindividual products, businesses, value chains,  \nor entire sectors, each time setting different  \nsystem boundaries for their assessments.  \nThis makes it very important for organisations  \nto clearly communicate which scope they have \napplied to their analysis when reporting on  \ncircular economy performance, much like the  \nuse of Scope 1, 2 or 3 in communications on \ngreenhouse gas emissions. More guidance on \nproper scope setting in the field of circular  \neconomy performance measurement can be  \nfound in our white paper on this topic: Circular \nEconomy Boundary Framework: Setting circularity \nscopes for impact and material measurements .\n56\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nBased on years of research, we know the potential \nof the circular economy to meet the needs of \npeople around the globe while bringing material \nuse back within the safe limits of our planet—\nhelping to decouple wellbeing from resource \nconsumption and environmental impacts. We \nalso now know that we’re not yet leveraging this \npotential: much remains to be harnessed. The \nprevious chapter of this report outlined the ‘what’, \nhighlighting trends of concern, pinpointing where \nwe’re not on track and quantifying baselines \nfrom which to measure and monitor progress. It \nshowed how various headline indicators relate to \nand interact with each other, acting as levers to \nboost the Circularity Metric. By minimising ‘linear’ \ninputs, optimising stock build-up, and ensuring the \ncircularity of biomass, we could be well on our way \nto a more circular world. Now that we know what \nneeds to be done, this chapter synthesises our \nkey findings into five crucial and interconnected \ngoals to rally behind and explores the ‘how’. It \nhighlights the actions key stakeholders across \ngovernment and industry should take to create the \nright environment for a global circular economy to \nflourish and implement real circular solutions on \nthe ground.\n3 The way forward\nCalls to action for stakeholders \nin government and business\n57\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nThe rate of secondary material  \nuse is steadily decreasing, and the \nvast majority of materials entering \nthe economy are virgin. We need  \nto reduce global resource demand  \nand scale down material throughput \nwith sufficiency strategies that  \navoid demand for materials,  \nenergy, land and water while \nproviding for people’s wellbeing \nwithin planetary boundaries.\nAlthough the scale of secondary material use is \nslowly increasing, the rate is falling, outpaced \nby overall growth in virgin material use. In 2021, \nwe reached a historical milestone, reaching 100 \nbillion tonnes of material extraction in one year. \nThis is more than a three-times increase from \n1970, with average growth of 2.3% per year. \nWhy is this critical?  Growing global resource \nuse is the main driver of the triple planetary \ncrisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and \npollution.\n151 At the same time, concerns related \nto resource depletion and long-term resilience \nenable governments and businesses to explore \nways to make economies less material intensive. \nWe should boost secondary material use \nand reduce extraction in tandem, and help \nensure governments and businesses embrace \nprinciples of resource efficiency and sufficiency. \nThis means promoting circular design \nprinciples, optimising the lifetime of existing \nproducts and components, and ensuring \nrecycled material inputs become the norm for \nbusinesses in many industries and regions.\nWe’re consuming more and more \nbiomass at the expense of the  \nsafety and stability of the natural \nworld, driving climate change and \nbiodiversity collapse. Biomass \nextraction and use aren’t sustainable \nby default: they need to meet strict \nsustainability criteria to safeguard \necosystems.\nEcological cycling, a cornerstone of the circular \neconomy, is a major blindspot that requires \nmore critical attention. Although it’s widely \naccepted that renewable resources play a \nstarring role in a circular economy, it’s crucial \nnot to assume that using more renewable \nresources is sustainable by default. Biomass \nextraction has more than doubled in the last 50 \nyears, and poor practices like heavy fertiliser \nuse, inefficient land allocation and use, and food \nwaste generation are commonplace.\nWhy is this critical?  Biomass extraction drives \na range of environmental impacts worldwide: it \nrepresents nearly one-fifth of global emissions \nand accounts for over 90% of land-related \nbiodiversity loss.\n152 All nations and industries \ninherently depend on biomass and the \necosystem services it sustains—from clean air \nand water to soil fertility and climate regulation. \nA functioning natural ecosystem is fundamental \nto economic stability and human well-being. \nWe should  make biomass use (and ultimately, \nland use management) truly sustainable by \nensuring extraction allows for sustainable \nregeneration, prevents waste and pollution, \nand supports biodiversity. Nutrients need to be \ncycled back into the ecosystem in the right place \nand at the right rate, and carbon emissions \nshould be minimised.\n58\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nRapid stock build-up is a key \ndriver of growing resource use. \nOptimising material stock build-up \nwill be key to achieving long-term \nresource efficiency and sufficiency \nwhile reducing excessive material \naccumulation.\nAlmost two-fifths of materials consumed \nby the global economy each year feed into \nstock build-up—net materials accumulated in \nnew buildings, infrastructure and machinery \nthat stay in use for many years. This rate has \ngrown spectacularly, with stocks increasing \n23-fold over the 20th century. Stock build-up \nis not inherently ‘bad’; on the contrary, many \ncountries need to invest to ensure that the local \npopulations have access to basic services, and \nwe need to build up infrastructure globally \nto support renewable energy generation, \ndistribution and storage capacity. However, \nstocks should be built up and managed with \ncare to ensure optimal resource use.\nWhy is this critical? Stock build-up is a key \ndeterminant of past, present and future \nmaterial flows. To reduce waste, emissions, \nand overconsumption, preventing the excess \naccumulation of materials in stock is essential. \nWhat’s more, materials available for stock build-\nup are finite: as increasingly-rare metal inputs \nbecome locked up in long-lived assets, for \nexample, nations and industries will not be  \nable to maintain current infrastructure levels \nwithout adopting circular approaches to \nresource management.\nWe should  flatten the spike in global material \nuse by minimising unnecessary stock growth \nin high-income economies—prioritising \nrenovation and adaptation over building \nnew, for example. At the same time, we \nneed to sustainably optimise and manage \nstock expansion through compact, urban \ndevelopment and circular design principles  \nin lower-income countries. Increasing  \nhigh-value resource recovery from construction \nand demolition waste and recovering critical \nmetals from infrastructure and equipment  \nwill also be crucial.\nTo transition away from fossil fuel \nconsumption, we must accelerate \nelectrification and scale up the \ndeployment of well-designed, \nrenewable energy systems to \nsustainably meet growing energy \nneeds.\nFrom a raw materials perspective, the share  \nof fossil fuels relative to total material \nextraction has shrunk over the past fifty  \nyears—but absolute fossil fuel use is still \nincreasing. While there’s been some progress  \nin terms of electrification and renewable  \nenergy deployment, this is not occurring  \nat the speed and scope necessary to reach \nglobal targets. To progress towards an \nelectrified world powered by renewables,  \nwe need to undertake the physical \ntransformation needed to decarbonise \neconomies, following circular principles.\nWhy is this critical?  Fossil fuel use is the \nlargest contributor of global greenhouse gas \nemissions, responsible for 78%.\nWe should reduce the rate and scale of fossil \nfuel consumption—transitioning existing \nfossil-based energy capacity to renewable \ntechnologies designed for longevity, reuse \nand recycling, reducing the need for ongoing \nmaterial use in the long-term. \n59\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nThe overall scale of virgin, non-\nrenewable materials destined \nfor landfill is growing. We need to \nminimise wasteful processes across \nkey resource-intensive supply \nchains by prioritising circular design, \nsufficiency and efficient resource \nuse, and better manage unavoidable \nwaste.\nMore than one-fifth of global material use \nis represented by materials that could be \ncycled but currently are not. This indicator \nhas grown by more than one billion tonnes \nbetween 2018 and 2021. Consumption and \nextraction are growing rapidly, greatly \noutpacing improvements in resource recovery \ntechnologies and waste management capacity. \nWhile collection rates are improving, value \nrecovery remains far too low. Secondary raw \nmaterials still face price competition from \ncheaper virgin materials, so advancements \nin recycling technologies and environmental \nregulations are needed to shift the market.\nWhy is this critical?  A large portion of the \nwaste produced by the global economy isn’t \nproperly handled, and materials mismanaged \nalong the supply chain represent a huge lost \nopportunity for value recovery. At the same \ntime, landfilling and uncontrolled disposal \nremain a pervasive social and environmental \nchallenge linked to a range of impacts, from \npollution to health hazards to land degradation.\nWe should reduce this indicator to as close to \n0% as possible. Circular design principles can \nprevent the generation of difficult-to-manage \nwastes. Infrastructure should be developed to \nincrease high-value applications for waste, and \nwaste management infrastructure should be \nimproved and backed by regulation. \n60\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nTake the lead in enabling circular resource \nuse: system-level transformation requires \ngovernments to set a clear vision and drive the \nmuch-needed economic upgrade. This means \ndriving a strategic approach to resource policy, \nensuring decisive actions follow intentions. It goes \nwithout saying: the shift to a circular economy \ncannot happen without the right policy environment \nand government action that phases out wasteful \npractices and promotes and supports smarter ways \nof meeting people’s needs. Political leadership \nis crucial to set priorities, drive investment, and \nbuild public support for change. Governments may \nhave a bigger role to play than correcting market \nfailures: they should actively shape economies to \nreduce dependence on virgin materials, cut waste \nand emissions, and create viable new opportunities \nfor businesses and workers. They rally behind and \nunify circular initiatives and set the objectives \nnecessary to address urgent socioeconomic \nchallenges in a rapid, socially just way. In parallel, \nthere is room to embed circular economy thinking \nand interventions into existing climate policy efforts \nby building circularity into Nationally Determined \nContributions, for example.\n153\nShape the right economic conditions for \ncircularity to flourish. Governments have the \npotential to reshape economic incentives in line \nwith circular economy principles, ensuring that \nthey become the default rather than the exception. \nMarket designs and pricing mechanisms need to \nbe aligned with circular economy goals: rethinking \nfiscal policies and regulating finance so that flows \nof capital are redirected to sustainable resource use \nand away from linear, resource-depleting, polluting \nactivities. A smart policy mix can level the playing \nfield and encourage businesses to transform their \noperations. Governments can also strengthen \nextended producer responsibility (EPR) and eco-\ndesign regulations to not only promote smarter \nwaste management but drive circular design \nby encouraging circularity upstream, ensuring \nproducts are designed for durability, repairability \nand recyclability from the outset.\n154 These measures \nboth drive sustainability and help build more \nresilient economies by reducing dependence on \nfinite resources, mitigating supply chain risks, and \nfostering long-term economic stability.\nActively support and participate in global \ngovernance, as no country can tackle resource \nuse reduction in a vacuum. In our highly  \nglobalised world, international collaboration is \nessential to effectively managing global material \nflows and reducing extraction. Despite increasing \nrecognition of resource overconsumption, there \nis no global governance framework to help \nensure sustainable resource use nor targets to \nwork towards. An international body—akin to the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or \nIntergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on \nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services—could help \nsteer action by providing science-based assessments \nand policy guidance. This body  \nwould focus on shaping long-term resource \nmanagement by setting global benchmarks, \ntracking material use, and guiding value chain \ntransformation. This aligns with suggestions made in \nthe negotiating text of the legally binding agreement \non plastics pollution, for example.\n155  \nThis would provide countries and companies  \nwith ambitious, science-based insights to inform  \nmaterial use targets alongside climate and \nbiodiversity goals. Immediate efforts towards  \nthis end goal could build upon existing work  \nin this area, such as the International Law \nAssociation’s Guidelines for Sustainable Natural \nResources Management\n156 and the International \nResource Panel’s Mineral Resource Governance  \nin the 21st century. 157\nWhat governments \ncan do\n61\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nEstablish an International Materials Agency to \nguide governments in measuring and monitoring \nsustainable resource use and circular economy \nprogress.  Robust data and transparency are \nessential for both monitoring the transition and \ncreating accountability. Improved transparency, \ndata collection, and reporting mechanisms aligned \nwith international standards are needed to drive \nsmarter decision-making. These systems help \nidentify trends, evaluate the impact of policies, and \nrefine strategies over time. They are also crucial \nto ensure that policy action is driving real change \nrather than merely shifting impacts elsewhere. \nCrucially, however, this agency’s role would be \ndistinct from target-setting—it would focus \nsolely on data provision. By providing access to \nconsolidated material flows and presenting their \nimpacts, an International Materials Agency could \nprovide relevant insights at the national level. In \nthis sense, it could provide better: (1) Orientation  \nthrough material consumption targets and related \nscience-based guidance, including a target akin to \na ‘net zero for materials’, (2) Measurement  \n  \nthrough \ndata, indicators and metrics that capture the \nwellbeing performance and material efficiency of \nkey provisioning systems such as housing, mobility, \nfood, and energy, and (3) Economic incentives  to \nrealign financial flows with resource-light, low-\ncarbon and nature-positive solutions. It could also \nensure the best-practice transfer of knowledge and \nfacilitate collaboration among practitioners across \npolicy and business.\n62\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nSet clear, measurable goals towards a circular \ntransition that is both environmentally \nresponsible and financially sustainable.  \nBusinesses need to adopt circular metric \nframeworks such as the Global Circularity \nProtocol and Circular Transition Indicators to set \nclear, measurable goals for the transition. This \nwill provide clarity to both internal and external \nstakeholders about their commitment to reducing \nmaterial use, promoting the reuse of products, \nand enhancing transparency—whilst remaining \ncompetitive. Through clearly defined resource \ntargets tied to business strategy and operations, \nbusinesses can demonstrate tangible progress on \ntheir circular economy journey while aligning their \noperations with sustainability goals.\nInvest in the circular economy now to ensure \nthat they remain competitive and future-proof. \nTransitioning to circular models provides new \nmarket opportunities. By investing in renewable \nresources, sustainable production technologies, \nreverse logistics infrastructure, and circular product \ndesign, businesses can secure long-term success, \nenhance their competitive edge, and reduce risks \nrelated to geopolitical matters, resource scarcity \nand regulatory changes. Rethinking product \nportfolios to align with circular principles—such \nas designing for durability, repairability, and \nrecyclability—will be key to adapting to evolving \nmarket demands. The global economy is now \nfacing increasing supply chain disruptions, \nparticularly for the critical raw materials essential \nto decarbonisation and digitalisation, as well as \na number of key manufacturing industries. With \nescalating demand, businesses that integrate \ncircular strategies and localise their operations \ncan shorten supply chains and ultimately reduce \ndependence on global markets. Circular business \nmodels can drive value through cost reduction, \nresource efficiency, and innovation, and the metrics \nused to track these activities—such as circular \ninflow (the use of recycled materials), circular \noutflow (end-of-life management), and waste/\nresource consumption avoided—will be essential to \nevaluate and scale their impact.\nCollaborate and work together within value \nchains to optimise resource use and drive \ninnovation. Businesses should collaborate across \nthe full value chain to optimise material use and \novercome economic split incentives. By joining \nforces with suppliers, manufacturers, and other \npartners, companies can drive innovation and \ninvest in the changes needed to make circular \nsolutions viable. Collaboration helps to build \neconomies of scale, reduce costs, and share \nknowledge, ultimately accelerating the adoption \nof circular practices across entire industries. In \ndoing so, businesses can also address the risks \ninherent in the current linear economy, such as \nsupply chain disruptions, resource scarcity, and \nincreasing regulatory burdens. By working together \nto shift to circular solutions, companies can unlock \nopportunities to create new markets, optimise \nmaterials use, and ensure long-term resilience.\nWhat businesses \ncan do\n63\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nAccumulated Stock  measures the total volume of \nmaterials added to socioeconomic stocks over time.\nCascading  is a method of retaining the ‘added value’ \nof materials for as long as possible through the \nsequential use of resources for different purposes—\nusually (or ideally) through multiple material (re)\nuse phases before energy extraction/recovery \noperations. [ Source]\nConsumption  refers to the usage or consumption \nof products and services meeting demand. Absolute \nconsumption  refers to the total volume of either \nphysical or monetary consumption of an economy, \ndomestic or global, as a whole. In this report, when \nwe talk about consumption , we are referring to \nabsolute consumption.\nCycling  refers to the process of converting a material \ninto a material or product of a higher (upcycling), \nsame (recycling) or lower (downcycling) embodied \nvalue and/or complexity than it originally was.\nDecoupling  refers to a trend that occurs when \nthe growth rate of an environmental impact (for \nexample, CO\n2 emissions) is less than that of its \neconomic driving force (for example, gross domestic \nproduct) over a given period. Decoupling can be \neither absolute or relative. Absolute decoupling  is \ndefined as when the environmental impact is stable \nor decreases when the economic driving force is \ngrowing. Relative decoupling  is defined as when the \ngrowth rate of the environmental impact is positive \nbut less than the growth rate of the economic driving \nforce. [ Source]\nDomestic Material Consumption  is an \nenvironmental indicator that covers the flows of \nboth products and raw materials by accounting for \ntheir mass. It can take an ‘apparent consumption’ \nperspective—the mathematical sum of domestic \nproduction and imports minus exports—without \nconsidering changes in stocks. It can also take a \n‘direct consumption’ perspective, in that products for \nimport and export do not account for the inputs—be \nthey raw materials or other products—used in their \nproduction. [Own elaboration based on Source ]\nEconomy-wide material flow  accounts is a \n‘statistical accounting framework describing the \nphysical interaction of the economy with the natural \nenvironment and with the rest of the world economy \nin terms of flows of materials.’ [ Source]\nGreenhouse gases (GHG)  refers to a group of \ngases contributing to global warming and climate \nbreakdown. The term covers seven greenhouse \ngases divided into two categories. Converting them \nto carbon dioxide equivalent  (CO\n2e) through the \napplication of characterisation factors makes it \npossible to compare them and to determine their \nindividual and total contributions to Global Warming \nPotential (see below). [ Source]\nGross Additions to Stock  measures the total  \namount of materials used in long-lived applications  \n(of over one year) in the accounting year. In the \ncontext of this analysis, this can include both virgin \nand secondary materials.\nHigh-value recycling  refers to the extent to \nwhich, through the recycling chain, the distinct \ncharacteristics of a material (the polymer, the glass \nor the paper fibre, for example) are preserved or \nrecovered so as to maximise their potential to be re-\nused in a circular economy. [ Source]\nMaterials , as referred to in this report, are non-\nmetallic minerals, metal ores, biomass, and fossil \nfuels, used as inputs to production or manufacturing \nbecause of their properties. Materials are a type \nof natural resource, alongside land and water, for \nexample.\nMaterial extraction  is an environmental indicator \nthat measures, in physical weight, the amount of raw \nmaterials extracted from the natural environment for \nuse in any economy. It excludes water and air. At the \nnational level, this indicator is called Domestic Material \nExtraction. [ Source]\nMaterial footprint , also referred to as Raw Material \nConsumption, is the attribution of global material \nextraction to the domestic final demand of a  \ncountry—referred to as a consumption-based \napproach . The material footprint equals the total \nvolume of virgin materials embodied within the  \nsupply chain to meet final demand. At the global  \nlevel, Raw Material Consumption is equivalent to \nmaterial extraction (see above). [ Source] \nAppendix A: Glossary\n64\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\nMaterial flows represent the amounts of \nmaterials in physical weight that are available to \nan economy. These material flows comprise the \nextraction of materials within the economy as \nwell as the physical imports and exports (such as \nthe mass of goods imported or exported). Air and \nwater are generally excluded. [ Source]\nNet Additions to Stock  measures the net \namount of materials long-lived applications after \naccounting for materials removed from existing \nAccumulated Stocks through Demolition and \nDiscard. This flow only contains virgin materials, \nas the amount of secondary materials in both \nGross Additions to Stock and Demolition and \nDiscard is assumed to be equal within the same \naccounting year.\nPlanetary boundaries  define the ‘safe operating \nspace’ for humanity based on the planet’s key \nbiophysical processes. Originally developed by \nRockström et al. (2009), the framework quantifies \nnine ‘limits’ for ensuring a stable and resilient \nEarth system. Six of nine boundaries have now \nbeen transgressed. [ Source]\nResources  include, for example, arable land, \nfreshwater, and materials. They are seen as \nparts of the natural world that can be used for \neconomic activities that produce goods and \nservices. Material resources are biomass (like \ncrops for food, energy and bio-based materials, as \nwell as wood for energy and industrial uses), fossil \nfuels (in particular coal, gas and oil for energy), \nmetals (such as iron, aluminium and copper used \nin construction and electronics manufacturing) \nand non-metallic minerals (used for construction, \nnotably sand, gravel and limestone). [ Source]\nResource efficiency means creating more \n(economic) value with less input of resources (for \nexample, raw materials, energy, water, air, land, \nsoil, and ecosystem services) and reducing the \nenvironmental impacts associated with resource \nuse to break the link between economic growth \nand the use of nature. Therefore, resource \nefficiency is closely linked to the concept of \n(relative/absolute) decoupling. [ Source]\nSecondary materials  are materials that \nhave been used once and are recovered and \nreprocessed for subsequent use. This refers to the \namount of the outflow that can be recovered to \nbe re-used or refined to re-enter the production \nstream. One aim of dematerialisation is to \nincrease the amount of secondary materials used \nin production and consumption to create a more \ncircular economy. [ Source]\nSufficiency , as defined by the IPCC, is a set of \npolicy measures and daily practices that avoid \ndemand for energy, materials, land, water, and \nother natural resources while delivering human \nwellbeing for all within planetary boundaries. \n[Source]\nTotal material consumption  is calculated by \nadding Raw Material Consumption (material \nfootprint) and secondary material consumption \n(cycled materials). \n65\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025\n\n1.

In \nthis economy we help businesses, cities and nations leverage \nbusiness opportunities, reduce costs, create jobs and inspire \nbehavioural change. As a global impact organisation, our \ninternational team equips business leaders and policymakers \nwith the insights, strategies, and tools to turn circular ambition \ninto action. \nCircle Economy has been at the forefront of the circular \neconomy transition since 2012. Our annual Circularity Gap \nReport sets the standard for measuring progress and we \nmanage the world’s largest circularity database, encompassing \ndata from over 90 nations, 350 cities, and 1,000 businesses. \n \n \n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025 provides a comprehensive progress report on the state of the \nglobal circular economy. With the understanding that the circular economy transition is about \nmore than just recycling, the report opens up the ‘Circularity Gap’, providing a wealth of headline \nand sub-indicators to support the Circularity Metric—measured by Circle Economy since 2018. It \npresents and builds on the Circularity Indicator Set, a dashboard of 11 indicators, incorporating \nbeneﬁcial aspects of other leading frameworks: ISO/DIS 59020:2023(E): Circular \nEconomy—Measuring and Assessing Circularity and the Conference of European Statisticians \nGuidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: Conceptual Framework, Indicators and \nMeasurement Framework. This complementary white paper gives deeper insight into the \nCircularity Indicator Set, explores the structure and scope of the two additional frameworks, and \nlays out how we’ve incorporated these in our work. \n2. UNPACKING THE CIRCULARITY INDICATOR \nSET \nThe Circularity Indicator Set is a system of tiered indicators designed to measure how circular an \neconomy is. This indicator set and its underlying measurement framework, which are explored in \nmore depth in the methodology document of the Circularity Gap Report 2025, has been \nhistorically used by and built upon by Circle Economy to provide insight into all inputs and \noutputs of an economy. Our ‘Circularity Metric’—or Input Technical Cycling rate—is perhaps the \nmost well-known of these indicators. Collectively, the Indicator Set examines the relationships \nbetween resources we take from nature, how we use them, and their impact on the \nenvironment. In alignment with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts Central \nFramework (SEEA-CF), this framework is centred on the idea of a socioeconomic system that \nrests ‘inside’ the environment, with materials \nﬂowing between and within the two. Although this \nanalysis has a global scope, the measurement framework can be set up at the (multi- and \nsub-)national level to account for trade and the movement of materials between nations, which \nis important when assessing environmental footprints. Circle Economy supports national and \nregional economies in using the Circularity Indicator Set for analysis, but is also using it for \ntargeted assessments, such as for industries: the Circularity Gap Report Textiles, launched in 2024, \nfor example. The Indicator Set can also be adapted for analysis at the product level.  This \nﬂexibility comes from its tiered structure, which allows for detailed or broader analysis \ndepending on the context. The Indicator Set relies—as much as possible—on highly-harmonised \nand regularly updated data, ensuring accurate comparisons between countries and enabling the \nconsistent monitoring of progress toward a circular economy. This framework lends itself well to \nintegration with other leading indicator frameworks for the circular economy, discussed in the \nfollowing section.  \nThe Circularity Indicator Set is grounded in the SEEA-CF, and its subsystem of Economy-Wide \nMaterial Flow Accounts (EW-MFA), and builds upon leading academic work in the ﬁeld of \n \n\nindustrial ecology.1 2 3 4  It expands on the scope of traditional EW-MFA, providing a more \ncomprehensive measure of the scale and circularity of total material and waste ﬂows. This \ncomprehensive measure is enabled by core features of the Set, discussed in more detail below:  \n● The distinction between rate and scale indicators to measure circularity at both the \ninput and output side; \n● The distinction between technical and ecological cycles; \n● The distinction between natural and anthropogenic ﬂows; \n● The distinction between material ﬂows and stocks. \nRate and scale indicators. Rate indicators, expressed as percentages of a total, measure the \n‘circular performance’ of an economy. An Input Technical Cycling rate (Circularity Metric) of 0% \nrepresents a fully linear economy, while a rate of 100% represents a (thermodynamically \nunfeasible) perfect circular economy, where all processed materials are cycled without losses. \nEach indicator in the Set is also ascribed a ‘scale’ \nﬁgure, which expresses the material use as an \nabsolute value. Rate and scale indicators are measured at both the input and output side (see \nTable one). \nTechnical and ecological cycling rates. The technical cycle refers to the processes that \nproducts and materials ﬂow through in order to maintain their highest possible value at all \ntimes. It involves ﬁnite materials (alongside small amounts of biomass that enter the technical \ncycle) that are not consumed during use and industrial processes such as reuse, refurbishment, \nremanufacturing and recycling. In the Circularity Gap Report approach speciﬁcally, it includes \nrecyclable end-of-life waste handled by waste management (on the output side) and \nreintroduced into the market as secondary materials (on the input side) - as well as reused \nproducts and by-products that are cycled without becoming waste. It does not include \nﬂows \nrelated to other processes that extend product lifetimes such as repair, sharing, refurbishment \nor remanufacturing. The ecological cycle refers to the processes—such as composting and \nanaerobic digestion—that collectively help regenerate natural capital. It involves renewable \nmaterials that can decompose and reintegrate into natural cycles, preferably regenerating and at \nthe very least without harming ecosystems. In the Circularity Gap Report approach speciﬁcally, it \nrefers to the ﬂow of carbon-neutral biomass and the resulting outﬂows to the environment, \nwhich re-enter global biogeochemical cycles and are separate from the technical system. Both \nrates—referring to technical and ecological cycling—are based on the same system deﬁnitions \nand measured against the same reference ﬂow: processed materials, whether for input or \ninterim output.. This shared denominator ensures that the rates are consistent, mutually \n4 Haas, W., Virág, D., Wiedenhofer, D., & von Blottnitz, H. (2023). How circular is an extractive economy?

It also makes them \napplicable at diﬀerent scales, from sector-level analyses to global assessments. \nNatural and anthropogenic ﬂows. Natural ﬂows are resources (such as extracted raw \nmaterials on the input side) or residuals (discharged waste and emissions on the output side) \nthat originate from or are destined to return to the environment. Notably, natural ﬂows can \ninclude both ecological, potentially-renewable materials, as well as inert non-renewable ones, \nsuch as metals, non-metallic minerals and fossil fuels. Anthropogenic \nﬂows, by contrast, \noriginate from or are destined to return to socioeconomic systems. While natural ﬂows contain \nonly resources, anthropogenic ﬂows can also contain man-made manufactured or \nsemi-manufactured products in addition to resources. This distinction is particularly relevant in \nthe context of trade and the calculation of Raw Material Equivalents5 in material footprinting. \nFlows and stocks. Activities in the socioeconomic system6 are fed by ﬂows of materials: these \ncome from the natural environment, are processed by industries, and are then either \naccumulated in physical stocks or transformed and released back into the environment as waste \nor emissions. Materials added to stocks—like buildings, infrastructure, and durable goods like \nmachinery, equipment and vehicles—are represented by the indicator Net Additions to Stock. \nThis indicator measures the physical growth of an economy, and exposes the time lag between \nmaterial consumption and waste generation. Although circular activities like repair, \nremanufacturing and sharing are not explicitly captured by the Circularity Indicator Set, their \nimpact is implicitly captured by Net Additions to Stock: we would expect to see an increase in the \nservice lifetimes of in-use stocks and potentially a stabilisation in the growth of in-use stocks.  \nTable one provides values for each headline indicator on the input and output side for 2021, the year of \nlatest available data.7 \n \nIndicator \nInput Output \nRate (%) Scale \n(billion \ntonnes) \nRate (%) Scale (billion \ntonnes) \nCircular \nmaterial \nﬂ\nows \nTechnical Cycling \nrate 6.9% 7.3 11.2% 7.3 \nEcological Cycling \nPotential rate 21.5% 22.8 35.5% 23.2 \nLinear \nmaterial \nﬂ\nows \nNon-Renewable \nBiomass rate 2.2% 2.3 3.4% 2.2 \nNon-Renewable \nFlows rate 18.1% 19.2 28.6% 18.8 \n7 Circle Economy analysis. \n6 Socioeconomic systems are large systems with people at the core, including social, economic, scientiﬁc, technological, \nand ecological environment ﬁelds, involving various aspects of human activities and the many complex factors of the \nliving environment. \n5 Raw Material Equivalents refers to all the materials used to manufacture each component of a product.

As we’ve explored diﬀerent themes linked to the circular economy—from climate \nbreakdown and the planetary boundaries to jobs and well-being—we’ve continually strived to \nfurther develop and improve upon the Circularity Indicator Set, based on leading academic \nwork. Improvements include: \n● The systematic inclusion of trade ﬂows for recycled waste and by-products, following \nEurostat’s Circular Material Use Rate methodology, as well as trade ﬂows of reused \nproducts when national data is available; \n● Accounting for domestically consumed by-products and reused products based on \nnational sources, if accessible; \n● The integration of indirect ﬂows, or the upstream raw material requirements of trade, \nallowing for indicators to be calculated using both apparent consumption (Domestic \nMaterial Consumption) and material footprint (Raw Material Consumption); \n● Cross-checking and reconciling results from the traditional and extended EW-MFA \napproaches to ensure robust and consistent outputs. \n.  \n3. OTHER LEADING INDICATOR FRAMEWORKS \nISO/DIS 59020:2023(E): Circular Economy—Measuring and \nAssessing Circularity \nThe recently published ISO/DIS 59020:2023(E) Circular Economy—Measuring and Assessing \nCircularity document, created by the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO), is the \nﬁrst authoritative eﬀort to standardise quantitative assessments of the circular economy. It is \npart of the broader ISO 59000 series, which establishes shared terminology, principles, and \nguidelines to help organisations eﬀectively implement circular strategies. This series also \nincludes ISO/DIS 59004 Circular Economy—Terminology, Principles and Guidance for \nImplementation, for example, discussed in more detail below. The ISO standard provides \nguidance for evaluating circularity, promoting sustainable resource management, and \n \n\nencouraging transparency in reporting. While the ISO/DIS 59020 standard is largely \noperational—meaning it’s centred on boundary setting, data acquisition, quality assurance, and \ndocumentation and reporting—it also establishes a measurement framework along with 14 core \ncircularity indicators (learn more about types of frameworks in the text box on page 10).  \nThese indicators take a multilevel perspective, pertaining to systems (regions, organisations, and \nproducts), structures (subsystems, sub-regions, and functional units, for example) and circular \nactivities (such as reuse, repair, and so on). Indicators are also structured along four categories: \nenergy, water, economic value, and in\nﬂows and outﬂows of resources. Resource indicators \ncategorise inﬂows and outﬂows into four mutually exclusive types—recycled, reused, virgin \nrenewable, and virgin non-renewable—which prevents overlap and adds up to 100%. The \nframework also factors in stocks—which remain in use over time—though this is done as a \nseparate indicator, assessing product lifetimes in comparison to industry averages rather than \nfully integrating stock levels into material ﬂow calculations. \nThe ISO/DIS measurement framework and indicator set are both relatively simple. The \nmeasurement framework deﬁnes the system being analysed in terms of its level, structure, and \nactions. The system in focus is embedded into environmental and social systems, with a few \ngeneral ﬂows describing how they interact with each other: ‘primary resource inﬂows’ represents \nthe sourcing of materials from the environment, for example, while ‘non-circular resource \noutputs’ represents the outﬂow of materials to the environment. Inﬂows and outﬂows can also \nbe considered ‘circular’ depending on the system boundary they cross: they can be internal, \nstaying within the system in focus (reprocessing of scrap, for example), re-entering from the \nsocioeconomic system (through recycling, for example), or re-entering from the environmental \nsystem (through composting, for example). In this framework, trade ﬂows and interactions with \nother ‘systems’—such as other national economies—are not speciﬁed.  \nISO/DIS 59004 Circular Economy—Terminology, Principles and Guidance for Implementation, \nseparate from the measurement framework, lays out terms and deﬁnitions, transitioning \nprinciples, and general practical aspects of shifting to a circular economy. While this is useful for \norganisations to understand and contribute to circularity, it does not systematically or \nstructurally organise the indicators proposed in the standard. In the ISO/DIS 59020 standard,  \nﬁve categories of core indicators—resource inﬂows, resource outﬂows, energy, water, and \nvalue—are not directly addressed by the document. It instead largely centres on general \nprinciples organisations should align with—system thinking and value creation, for \nexample—and actions they should carry out, such as design for circularity, repair, and recycling. \nWhat’s more, although the standard acknowledges the interconnectedness of economic, social, \nand environmental systems and suggests complementary methods for impact assessment, it \nlacks a structured, interlinked framework for measuring circularity. Critical aspects like \nenvironmental impact, employment eﬀects, supply security, and policy considerations are \nmentioned but not integrated into a cohesive measurement approach. As a result, the ISO 59000 \nseries serves as a conceptual foundation but falls short of oﬀering a comprehensive indicator \nframework for the circular economy. \n \n\nUNECE/OECD: Conference of European Statisticians Guidelines \nfor Measuring Circular Economy—Part A: Conceptual \nFramework, Indicators and Measurement Framework \nThis document, prepared jointly by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \n(UNECE) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is among \nthe most comprehensive publications on measuring circular progress at the national level. Its \nheadline deﬁnition captures the core principles shared across circular economy models: \nmaximising the value of materials for as long as possible, minimising material input and \nconsumption, preventing waste, and reducing negative environmental impacts throughout a \nmaterial’s life cycle. Contrary to the ISO standard, the UNECE/OECD guidelines also oﬀer a \nconceptual framework (see text box on page 10), and combines the main features of a circular \neconomy—such as the four ﬂows*8 9—with the basic principles of environmental accounting and \nreporting.10 11 12 All dimensions of the circular economy—including physical, environmental, and \nsystemic aspects across the entire lifecycle of materials, products, and services—are covered. \nCore indicators are structured according to four main so-called ‘building blocks’: the material \nlife cycle and value chain, interactions with the environment, socioeconomic \nopportunities, and responses and actions (including innovation, regulatory and other \ninstruments, and education, for example).  \nEach building block has a subset of themes and topics that provide an increasing level of detail, \nwith each theme and topic having its own set of complementary and contextual indicators.13 The \nfull set comprises 16 core indicators (plus 5 placeholders for situations where no suitable \nindicator can be identiﬁed), more than 70 complementary indicators, and 13 contextual \nindicators.14 While these all ﬁt within one overarching conceptual and measurement framework, \nthey still act as stand-alone indicators for a broad range of interlinked topics; however, while this \nset comprehensively covers all aspects relevant to the circular economy, it lacks a common \ndenominator, meaning that indicators may use diﬀerent units, methods or scales. This \nfundamental diﬀerence between indicators means that they lack a common basis for \ncomparison or aggregation, making it diﬃcult to integrate into a cohesive whole.  \n14 Core and complementary indicators are related to each other: for instance, the ‘National recycling rate’ indicator is \nrelated to the ‘Waste going to ﬁnal disposal’, ‘Circular material use rate’, and ‘Ratio of products repaired or reused to new \nproducts sold’ indicators. However, the link between them is underspeciﬁed, posing a number of questions: are they \ncalculated using the same or similar metrics? Where and how do they diﬀer? Do they overlap? \n13 For example, the ‘material life cycle and value chain’ building block is divided into three themes: the ﬁrst of these ‘The \nmaterial basis of the economy—production, consumption, accumulation” is further divided into three topics, ‘Material \ninputs’, ‘Material consumption’ and ‘Accumulation’. A number of indicators is characterised for each. \n12 OECD. (1993). Core set of indicators for environmental performance reviews. Environmental Monograph, 83. \n11 UNEP. (2021).

(2016).  \nAs noted, the OECD/UNECE guidelines ﬁrst deﬁne a conceptual framework, within which the \nmeasurement framework is embedded. Notably—and in contrast to the ISO/DIS standard—the \nguidelines explicitly cover the interactions between the system in focus (a national economy, for \nexample) with other economies and their environments. It considers the cross-border impacts \nbetween socioeconomic systems, particularly those linked to trade and their e\nﬀects on natural \nassets and environmental quality both domestically and internationally.  \nThe ‘material life cycle and value chain’ building block is the core of measuring the circular \neconomy. It is ﬁrst translated into simple measurement concepts comparable to those given by \nthe ISO/DIS 59020 framework. Next, the framework is expanded to focus on interactions \nbetween the production and consumption system with the waste management system and \nother more informal waste management activities.  \nUnderstanding diﬀerent types of frameworks \nWhat to measure: A conceptual framework, such as that oﬀered by the UNECE/OECD \nguidelines, helps structure the selection of indicators to ensure all important aspects of the \ncircular economy are covered. It reﬂects the integrated, cross-cutting nature of the circular \neconomy and organises indicators in a way that’s practical and accessible for decision-makers \nand the public. \nHow to measure it, from a data perspective: A measurement and monitoring framework, \noﬀered by both the ISO standard and UNECE/OECD guidelines, helps to structure and \ncombine underlying data, link circular economy concepts and deﬁnitions to the terms and \ndeﬁnitions used in oﬃcial statistics, and ensure that data sets are coherent. These beneﬁt \npolicymakers by providing reliable, comparable and comprehensive data and indicators to \nsupport informed decision-making. \nHow to measure it, from a process perspective: An operational framework, such as that \noﬀered by the ISO standard, tells us how to measure circularity by providing rules, procedures \nand guidelines on the processes underlying the development and use of indicators. It can be \nused to implement measurement eﬀorts, replicate standardised results and compare them. \n \n4. INTEGRATING THE CIRCULARITY INDICATOR \nSET AND OTHER LEADING FRAMEWORKS \nEach of the leading frameworks discussed above brings its own beneﬁts. The UNECE/OECD’s \nconceptual and measurement frameworks oﬀer structure and comprehensiveness—although \nthe related indicator set lacks a common denominator. The ISO approach of oﬀering mutually \nexclusive indicators with a shared common denominator provides cohesiveness and unity, but \nlacks the comprehensiveness of the UNECE/OECD frameworks. The Circularity Indicator Set \nexhibits the beneﬁcial aspects of each, oﬀering a cohesive and comprehensive framework \n \n\nsuitable for many aims: the headline indicators, for example, are useful for raising awareness \nand communicating circular progress to a more general audience, while lower-tier indicators can \nprovide government oﬃcials, policy analysts and other technical stakeholders with the in-depth \ninformation needed to support decision making and agenda setting. The Set’s alignment with the \nUNECE/OECD guidelines and the ISO standard ensures that it both ﬁts into a broad and holistic \napproach to measuring circularity while complying with emerging standards on the topic. To this \nend, a full evaluation of the relationship between the Circularity Indicator Set, ISO standard and \nUNECE/OECD framework—which explores their coverage and alignment—is available in Tables \ntwo and three. \nTable two summarises the key elements of the ISO/DIS 59020:2023(E) standard and its alignment with the \nCGR methodology. \nElement Coverage/ \nAlignment Notes \nMeasurement dimensions \nand levels of application Partial \n‘The framework is applicable to multiple levels of \nan economic system, ranging from regional, \ninter-organisational, organisational to the product \nlevel.’ While the ISO standard is focused on the \norganisational (micro) level, the CGR \nmethodology is focused on the regional, \nnational and supranational (meso and macro) \nlevel. \nThree-step operational \nframework entailing: \nBoundary setting, circularity \nmeasurement and data \nacquisition and circularity \nassessment and reporting \nPartial \nWhile Boundary setting is inherently covered \n(ensuring appropriate boundaries and \nmeaningful outcome), certain elements of the \ncircularity measurement, data acquisition, \nassessment and reporting are not. For instance, \n‘appropriate indicators of value with careful \nconsideration of its retention, recovering or \naddition to \nresource value or restoration (e.g. regeneration of \necosystems’ is not covered. Speciﬁc goals for \ndata quality requirements are not formulated \nor explicit provision for public disclosure of \ncomparative assertions are not made. \nCircular goals, aspects and \nactions Partial \nGoals can be set in scenario modelling in the \nform of normative targets to explore their \nbroader environmental (and social) \nimplications.  \nActions (e.g. 9R strategies, composting, energy \nrecovery) are included in the CGR scope by the \ncircular strategies and reﬂected in the scenario \nmodelling framework. Aspects (e.g. durability, \nrecyclability, repairability) relate to qualitative \ncharacteristics of ﬂows which are typically not \n \n\nconsidered in either baseline nor scenario \nassessments. \nCircular measurement \ntaxonomy Partial \nThe Resource ﬂow measurement principle \ndeﬁned as ‘resource inﬂows and outﬂows \ncrossing boundaries of the system in focus \n(including losses and emissions)’ is aligned with \nthe EW-MFA economy-environmental boundary \ndeﬁnition. \nCircular categories and related indicators are only \nfully covered for resource inﬂows and outﬂow. \nHowever, those for energy, water and \neconomics are only partially aligned with the \nstandard. \nMeasuring and assessing \nsustainability impacts - \nThis is not covered by the standard itself, but a \nreference to other standards is made. The CGR \nmethodology and models allow us to \nquantitatively address elements of the social, \nenvironmental and economic impact & value— \nhowever they are currently not reported \n(except for carbon footprint). \nResource inﬂows and \noutﬂows Partial \n‘Sorting and processing losses’ in the recycling \nprocess as the diﬀerence between inputs and \noutput to the recycling operation are not \nquantiﬁed in CGR methodology. Inputs to the \nrecycling plant are considered a proxy for the \noutput from recycling plants in the current CGR \nmethodology. This doesn’t allow for a proper \ndistinction between recyclable (output) and \nrecycled (input) content. For stock additions \n(lifespan of more than one year) indicators of \ntime such as average lifetimes are not covered \nby the CGR methodology (static approach). \n \nTable three summarises the key elements of the OECD/UNECE framework and its alignment with the CGR \nmethodology. \nElement Coverage/ \nAlignment Notes \nAligned with SNA and SEEA \nframeworks Full \nEW-MFAs, AEAs, IOTs and the other building \nblocks of the CGR methodology are subsets of \nthe SNA and SEEA framework and therefore \nhighly aligned. \nFour building blocks based \non accounting and Bellagio Partial Only the Material life-cycle and value chain and \nelements of the Socioeconomic opportunities \n \n\nprinciples and the \npressure-state-response \n(PSR) model  \ncomponent are currently included. The \nmethodology and models allow us to \nquantitatively address elements of the \nInteractions with the environment component, \nhowever they are currently not reported \n(except for climate). The Responses and actions \ncomponent is mostly addressed qualitatively. \nMaterial life-cycle and \nvalue chain  Theme one: \nInteractions with trade and \nglobalisation \nFull \nIndicators on the level and characteristics of \nmaterial supply and their use in the economy or \nin industries—particularly material inputs, \nconsumption, and accumulation—as well as \nindicators that relate material use to GDP, \nvalue-added, or other socio-economic output \nvariables through intensity or productivity \nratios, are widely covered. \nMaterial life-cycle and \nvalue chain Theme two: \nManagement eﬃciency of \nmaterials and waste, and \nthe circularity of material \nﬂows \nFull \nIndicators on waste generation, recycling rates, \ncircular use rates, shares of secondary raw \nmaterials in material inputs or consumption; \nrenewable content of material used in \nproduction processes, products diverted from \nthe waste stream (repaired, remanufactured, \nreused), materials leaving the economic cycle, \ni.e. waste going to ﬁnal disposal, are widely \ncovered. \nMaterial life-cycle and \nvalue chain  Theme three: \nInteractions with trade and \nglobalisation \nFull \nIndicators on exports and imports of materials, \nsecond-hand goods, end-of-life products and \nwaste, the physical trade balance, and the \nmaterial intensity of trade, are widely covered. \nOECD environmental \nindicators 3-Tier structure \nbased on relevance, \nmeasurability and \nusefulness \nFull \nThe Circularity Indicator Set can be organised \ninto a 3-Tier structure where the UNECE/OECD’s \ncore and complementary indicators (Tier 1 and \n2) are both considered complementary (Tier 2) \nand contextual are the same. \nMeasurement dimensions \nand levels of application Partial \nThe framework needs to be scalable to the \ninterrelated levels the circular economy \noperates on the micro (e.g. products and \ncompanies), meso (e.g. sectors, industries, \ncities, sub-national governments) and macro \nlevel ( i.e. national or supranational economies). \nWhile the CGR framework lends well to \napplication to the macro and partially to the \nmeso level, it is not particularly suited to the \nmicro level. \nExpanded versus \ntraditional scope of waste Partial The CGR measurement framework covers all \nthe elements of the UNECE proposed extended \n \n\nstatistics scope of waste statistics. However, due to their \nexclusion from traditional waste statistics, the \ncoverage is usually quite limited. \nAfter years of providing a yearly check up on the global state of circularity—largely represented \nby a single metric—we’re shifting gears: the Circularity Gap Report’s goal is building out the \nCircularity Indicator Set to encompass the beneﬁcial aspects of the other leading frameworks \ndiscussed. This ﬁrst comprehensive and cohesive look at measuring the circular economy is \nexplored in more depth in Chapter three of the Circularity Gap Report 2025, which presents the \nCircularity Indicator Set supported by relevant sub-indicators for changemakers drawn from the \nUNECE/OECD frameworks. Our focus is on converging the ‘material life cycle and value chain’ \ntheme from the UNECE/OECD framework with the ‘resource inputs’ and ‘resource outputs’ \ncategories from the ISO/DIS 59020 framework, providing a common language for two \nframeworks that measure similar metrics but otherwise use varying scales and terminology. In \ndoing so, we beneﬁt from applying the ‘mutually exclusive’ logic of the resource inputs and \noutputs categories to the statistical domain of environmental accounts (for example, material \nﬂow, emissions, waste, and water accounts), from which many UNECE ‘material life cycle and \nvalue chain’ indicators are derived. This allows us to consistently measure themes relevant to the \ncircular economy—from the bioeconomy and energy transition to socioeconomic stocks—from \nboth a material inﬂow and outﬂow perspective. \nBarriers to fully integrating the ISO/DIS standard and the UNECE/OECD framework \nThe main barrier to fully integrating these work streams lies in a few fundamental diﬀerences \nin goals, scope and deﬁnitions. These are broadly summarised below: \n● Focus and application: The ISO/DIS 59020 standard is product- and process-oriented, \nproviding a technically precise framework for organisations conducting speciﬁc \ncircularity assessments. In contrast, the UNECE/OECD guidelines take a broader, more \nﬂexible approach, focusing on systemic issues and enabling circular economy \nmonitoring at regional and national levels. \n● Treatment of water and energy: The UNECE/OECD framework accounts for water \nand energy only in terms of their interactions with the environment: water pollution or \nenergy-related emissions, for example. However, it does not account for water or \nenergy consumption per se. The ISO/DIS standard does the opposite: it accounts for \nwater used in the processes under analysis and energy consumption in energy terms \n(i.e. kilowatt hours of electricity rather than tonnes of coal burnt), but does not \nexplicitly cover their environmental impacts. Nonetheless, the sustainable use of \nfreshwater and energy remains conceptually relevant to circular economy discussions. \n● Terminology and measurement: The ISO/DIS standard broadly deﬁnes ‘resources’ as \nincluding raw materials, feedstocks, and components. The UNECE/OECD framework, \nhowever, uses more precise statistical classiﬁcations, distinguishing between natural \nresources, primary and secondary raw materials, and residuals. While both \nframeworks align conceptually, their terminology does not fully overlap. ISO prioritises \n \n\nintegration with other ISO standards for consistency, whereas UNECE/OECD follows \nthe System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA) to bridge physical and \nmonetary statistics. This accounting-based approach is well-suited for macro- and \nmeso-level analysis but less eﬀective for assessing speciﬁc product lifespans, material \ncompositions, or production processes (for example, secondhand or bio-based \nmaterials). \nIn spite of these diﬀerences, the Circularity Indicator Set lends itself well to integration with both \nframeworks in terms of compliance (ISO) and superimposition (UNECE/OECD). The Circularity \nIndicator Set takes the same approach as the ISO standard, dividing resources into mutually \nexclusive categories: recycled and reused, virgin renewable, and virgin non-renewable materials. \nWhile the ISO standard was designed to apply this logic primarily at the product or organisational \nlevel, the Circularity Indicator Set scales it up for application at the national level, creating \nheadline indicators in both the input (materials entering the economy) and output (waste and \nemissions) side of the system under study. In order to better comply with the ISO standard, we \nhave introduced a number of other methodological modi\nﬁcations to the Circularity Indicator Set: \nthese are explored in detail in the text box below. \nModiﬁcations to the Circularity Indicator Set made by Circle Economy \n1. Diﬀerentiating between ‘Recycled/Reused’ and ‘Recyclable/Reusable’ materials: The \nISO/DIS 59020 standard requires that recycling and reuse are measured on both the input and \noutput side: \nInput: Measures the fraction of resources conﬁrmed as recycled content, including pre- and \npost-consumer materials but excluding internal industrial reuse. Reuse is strictly deﬁned as \nremanufacturing, excluding broader durability-related aspects like repair or refurbishment. \n● Output: Estimates the fraction of outﬂow content that was (or is likely to be) recovered \nand recycled into secondary materials or reused in production, maintenance, or repair. \nFrom an economy-wide perspective, this distinction allows us to diﬀerentiate between waste \ncollected for recycling and actual secondary materials.15 Waste collected for recycling is \nmeasured at the recycling plant gate, whereas secondary materials are tracked at their market \ndeployment point. The diﬀerence reﬂects sorting and processing losses, meaning Eurostat’s \nassumption that ‘input to recovery plants is an acceptable proxy for output’16 is no longer valid. \nThese losses must now be explicitly quantiﬁed. Distinguishing between reused and reusable \ncontent remains challenging due to a lack of statistical data and an undeveloped methodology. \n16 Eurostat. (2018). Circular material use rate – Calculation method. 2018 edition. Manuals and guidelines. Retrieved from: \nEurostat website  \n15 This requires a common de ﬁnition for ‘recyclable’ materials. ‘Recyclability’ is challenging to de ﬁne, with technical and \neconomic factors playing a role. \n \n\n2. Deﬁning and quantifying ‘Sustainably Produced Renewable Content’ and \n‘Recirculation—Safe Return to the Biosphere’: The ISO/DIS 59020 standard deﬁnes \nrenewable material as ‘biomass that is replenishable at a rate equal to or greater than the rate \nof depletion,’ with bio-based inﬂows considered circular only if they are sustainably managed. \nOn the output side, the ‘percent actual recirculation of outﬂow in the biological cycle’ indicator \nmeasures the fraction of biomass or nutrients safely returned to the biosphere (for example, \nvia composting or anaerobic digestion). These deﬁnitions align with the Ecological Cycling \nPotential indicator. While methodologies for systematically assessing the sustainability of \nbiomass are still evolving, the economy-wide biogenic carbon balance approach by Haas et al. \n(2020)17 serves as an initial proxy for estimating renewable biomass inputs and safe biological \nrecirculation. \n3. Aligning with a lifetime perspective on long-term products and materials: Measuring \nthe relationship between physical stock, durability, and value retention is complex in a circular \neconomy. The Circularity Indicator Set follows an EW-MFA approach, measuring stock \nadditions based on mass using a static balance method that does not e xplicitly model how \nlong products and embodied materials stay in use (technical lifetime) before becoming waste. \nThe ‘net stocking rate’ (expressed as a percentage) is treated as a mutually exclusive inﬂow \nindicator. As noted previously, circular economy strategies such as product lifetime extension, \nrenovation, and sharing can be indirectly observed through the potential stabilisation of in-use \nstock growth, as indicated by the Net Additions to Stock indicator. In contrast, the ISO/DIS \n59020 standard measures a product or material’s expected useful lifetime based on durability \nassessments that consider reliability and lifetime extensions through maintenance, repair, and \nrefurbishment. This reﬂects a key diﬀerence: \n● Circularity Indicator Set: Categorises material inﬂows and outﬂows by their destination \n(for example, stocked, technically cycled, or non cycled). \n● ISO/DIS 59020: Classiﬁes materials based on content (for example, virgin \nnon-renewable, recycled), with ‘stocked’ not considered a separate ﬂow type. \nTo comply with ISO/DIS 59020, the Circularity Indicator Set now includes a new \nindicator—‘average lifetime of stock relative to the global average’—alongside the traditional \nnet stocking rate. This sub-indicator oﬀers a more detailed view of material accumulation, \naligning with UNECE/OECD core indicators. \nSome of the Set’s indicators align directly with certain topics of the UNECE/OECD framework: for \nexample, the Input Technical Cycling rate and Output Technical Cycling rate directly measure the \ntopics ‘Circularity of material ﬂows’ and ‘Materials diverted from ﬁnal disposal through recycling \nor recovery’, respectively. Others, however, do so less directly. The Input Non-Renewable rate \nand Output Non-Renewable Rate, for example, account for the amount of potentially recyclable \nmaterials that are instead disposed of and can be used to measure the topic ‘Materials leaving \n17 Haas, W., Krausmann, F., Wiedenhofer, D., Lauk, C., & Mayer, A. (2020). Spaceship earth's odyssey to a circular \neconomy-a century long perspective. Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 163, 105076. \n \n\nthe economic cycle’. However, they are not suited to capturing the topic ‘Waste generation \n(materials ending up as waste)’. \nThe framework also contains a number of indicators that provide considerably more information \nthan the one-dimensional Indicator Set’s headline indicators: for example, indicators that \nmeasure intensities (such as energy intensity), trends, and material composition breakdowns. \nThe broader, multi-faceted coverage of the UNECE/OECD indicators o\nﬀers more operationality, \ncontext and nuance to their measurement.  \nHowever, while some of these core and complementary indicators are not directly represented \nby the Indicator Set’s headline indicators, they are necessary to calculate them. For instance, the \nInput Technical Cycling rate requires data on ‘Demand-based raw material consumption (RMC)’, \n‘National recycling rates’ for both municipal solid waste (MSW) and special waste, and ‘Trade in \nwaste, secondary materials, secondary raw materials, second-hand goods’. Similarly, the Input \nEcological Cycling Potential rate requires data on the ‘Proportion of materials from renewable \nnatural stocks in DMC’ as well as ‘Emissions and removals from land use, land-use change, and \nforestry’. \nThis conﬁguration oﬀers an ideal opportunity to superimpose the Circularity Indicator Set’s \nheadline indicators ‘on top of’ the relevant UNECE/OECD indicators, providing a cohesive \nhigher-level set of headline indicators with underlying, complementary UNECE/OECD \nindicators—among others—to support, enrich and expand upon the headline measurements. In \nthis setup, the Circularity Indicator Set’s headline indicators serve as a simpli\nﬁed overview, while \nthe UNECE/OECD indicators provide the detailed data needed to understand trends, variations, \nand broader implications. These form the headline and sub-indicators calculated and explored in \nChapter three of the Circularity Gap Report 2025.  \n \n \n\nTable four lists the Circularity Indicator Set structure and its relationship with key elements of the CES Guidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: Conceptual \nFramework, Indicators and Measurement Framework (theme, topics, tiered structure) and the ISO/DIS 59020 standard (category, content, principle). \n31 Territorial, production- and consumption-based perspectives. \n30 Territorial and consumption-based perspectives. \n25 Not reported in the CGR 2025 report because this is only relevant at the national level. \n21 Domestic use plus imports minus exports of waste destined to recycling, by-products and reused products.  \n19 Working list.

INTRODUCTION \n1.1 The need for a global circularity benchmark \nThe transition to a circular economy is central to addressing resource depletion, environmental \ndegradation and the general transpassing of planetary boundaries. However, achieving a truly \ncircular economy requires a systematic, data-driven approach that measures and tracks material \nﬂows and stocks, waste generation and treatment rates at diﬀerent scales—global, national, \nsectoral, and product-level. This document lays out the methodology used for the Circularity Gap \nReport (CGR) 2025. It provides a robust framework to measure material circularity, enabling \npolicymakers, researchers, and businesses to assess progress and identify areas for \nimprovement. \n1.2 Purpose and scope of the Circularity Gap Report 2025 \nmethodology \nThe CGR 2025 methodology is designed to: \n● Benchmark material circularity at the global level, with annual updates to track progress \nover time; \n● Provide a standardised Circularity Indicator Set (CIS) that quantiﬁes the scale of material \nand waste ﬂows and the rate of their reintegration into technical and ecological cycles; \n● Ensure methodological alignment with key international frameworks, including the \nConference of European Statisticians (CES) Guidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: \nConceptual Framework, Indicators and Measurement Framework and the ISO/DIS \n59020:2023(E) Circular Economy Standard to allow for comparability and transferability \nfrom the globe to other levels (national or industry or business); \n● Extend beyond traditional recycling metrics by capturing: \n○ The stock dynamics of materials (long-term material accumulations in \ninfrastructure and products); \n○ Trade implications, particularly the movement of secondary materials and waste \nacross borders; \n○ Technical and ecological cycling rates, distinguishing between materials that can \nbe reintroduced into industrial systems and those that follow natural \nbiogeochemical cycles. \n \nThe CGR 2025 calculations draw from over 100 multilateral and national data sources, along with \nexpert estimates and modelling techniques for data gap-ﬁlling, all of which is built into an \nextensive data infrastructure.  \n1.3 Conceptual and statistical foundations \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 3 \n\n\n \nThe CGR Measurement Framework builds upon established industrial ecology and material ﬂow \naccounting principles while expanding their scope to better capture the complexities of modern \nmaterial ﬂows.  \nThe methodology integrates several key concepts. It: \n1. Distinguishes between scale and rate indicators: \n○ Scale indicators measure the absolute magnitude of material ﬂows (for example, \ntotal material extraction, total waste generated). \n○ Rate indicators assess the circular and non-circular performance of an economy, \nand are expressed as percentages of the total amount of materials ﬂowing in and \nout of that economy (for example, the Circularity Metric, which measures the \nshare of secondary material consumption out of total material consumption). \n2. Diﬀerentiates between input-side and output-side circularity: \n○ Input-side indicators measure the share of particular materials streams (e.g., \nsecondary materials, carbon-neutral biomass) in total processed materials. \n○ Output-side indicators assess how much waste is being eﬀectively reintegrated \ninto technical or ecological cycles. \n3. Accounts for technical and ecological cycles: \n○ Technical cycle refers to the processes that products and materials ﬂow through \nin order to maintain their highest possible value at all times.

CIRCULARITY INDICATOR SET \nThe CIS is a system of tiered indicators—scoped out of a multi-thematic conceptual framework \nand grounded in a statistical measurement framework—that allows for a biophysical and \neconomy-wide assessment of a circular economy, including ﬂows-stocks relationships. In its \ncurrent implementation, the scope of the CIS is centred on the material life cycle, the economy’s \nproduction and consumption functions, and partly on their interactions with the environment in \nterms of natural assets and environmental quality implications. \nThe CIS’s headline indicators are based on extended EW-MFA principles taken from the work of \nMayer et al. (2018),3 Haas et al. (2020)4 and other prior research.5, 6, 7 The underlying \nmeasurement framework fully integrates waste ﬂows, recycling, and downcycled materials with \ntraditional EW-MFA statistics. In the CGR model, the approach is further extended to include \nindirect ﬂows, the trade of secondary materials, and other elements (see Section three). The CIS \nis designed for analysis at the macro-level (national, regional), however, it can also be applied at \nthe meso- and micro-level by considering lower-tier indicators (or proxies thereof) that can be \nmore suitable for sector- or product-level analysis. Given the statistical foundations of the \nunderlying CGR Measurement Framework, the CIS calculation relies as much as possible on \nharmonised and regularly updated data, producing comparable results that are suitable for \nbenchmarking across countries and that support consistent monitoring e\nﬀorts.  \nFor its headline indicators, the CIS distinguishes between scale indicators—which provide \nmeasures for the overall size of the socioeconomic metabolism—and rate indicators, which \nmeasure technical and ecological cycling relative to input and output ﬂows. Providing \nindependent measures for ﬂows on both the input and output sides is necessary and insightful \ndue to the delaying eﬀect that in-use stocks of materials have on output ﬂows.

It excludes \noxygen as well as bulk water ﬂows. \n11 Due to data limitations, it is assumed that waste destined for recycling is a good proxy for secondary materials that will \nbe deployed in the economy within the accounting year, according to Eurostat. In reality, there are time lags and \nineﬃciencies in the waste management system: this means that the amount of waste available for recycling and the \nsecondary materials ﬂowing into the economy in the same year are not necessarily the same. \n10 Processed materials include all primary and secondary material consumed within a deﬁned geographical scope. \n9 ‘Technical biomass’ refers to processed materials of biological origin that are diﬃcult to reintroduce into the biosphere \nsafely. These can be biological materials in short-lived applications such as paper, wood packaging, textiles, and bioplastic \nor long-term applications such as timber used for buildings. \n8 Although currently accounting only for materials recovered from recycling (secondary raw materials) and by-products, \nthis category also includes materials in products that have been reused, refurbished, or repaired as well as components \nthat have been remanufactured. \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 7 \n\n\n \nmaterial reserves at the \nnet of their depletions \n \nFor more information on the individual indicators, refer to Methodology for Nations (Section 4.1), \nwith the following notes: \n● Some names and deﬁnitions may diﬀer between the methodology documents for \nNations, Latin America and the Caribbean, and this document. For instance, in this \ndocument the term renewable biomass’ has been replaced with ‘Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass.’ In some cases, this is purely a change in terminology with no di\nﬀerence in \nmeaning. In others, the change in name reﬂects a change in meaning. \n● The methodology documents for Nations and Latin America and the Caribbean \ndistinguish between direct and life-cycle indicators, which are calculated based on either \nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC) or Raw Material Consumption (RMC) \nﬂows. While \nthis distinction is important for regional and national analyses, it is not relevant at the \nglobal level, where there is no diﬀerence between DMC and RMC. For this reason, the \ndistinction is not made in this document. However, it is important to note that the \ndiﬀerentiation between direct (DMC-based) and life-cycle (RMC-based) indicators remains \nrelevant in the broader CGR Measurement Framework and CIS, as the framework is \nstructured at the national level and global ﬁgures are derived from the aggregation of \nnational results. \n● Updates were made to the calculation of the IECPr indicator: \n○ The biomass fraction allocated to Gross Additions to Stocks (GAS) was excluded \nfrom the IECPr. This change prevents double counting between IECPr and NSr, \nand enables more precise monitoring of biomass entering the technical cycle; \n○ Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) emissions were replaced with \nemissions from deforestation in calculations related to the carbon-neutral share \nof biomass in the ECPr and NRBr indicators, on both the input and output sides. \nThis adjustment was made to avoid distorted inclusion of ‘credits,’ particularly \nthose linked to negative LULUCF emissions embodied in traded biomass \nproducts. \nWith the increasing number of frameworks and emerging standards for measuring circularity, \nthe issue of alignment and compatibility becomes relevant. To address this, the CIS was \nevaluated against two of the existing works on measuring circularity, namely: \n● The Conference of European Statisticians Guidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: \nConceptual Framework, Indicators and Measurement Framework prepared jointly by the \nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD); \n● The ISO/DIS 59020:2023(E) Circular economy—Measuring and assessing circularity standard, \nby the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 8 \n\n\n \nAreas for improvement and alignment were identiﬁed and new features developed, including an \nexpanded tiered structure to increase the interpretability and operationalisation of the CIS. Table \ntwo summarises key relationships between the CIS and the other two frameworks and illustrates \nthe new tiered structure with the underlying sub-indicators.

CGR MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK \nGrounded in the Common Framework of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts \n(SEEA-CF) and its EW-MFA subsystem, the CGR Measurement Framework  builds upon leading \nacademic work in the \nﬁeld of industrial ecology by extending the scope of traditional EW-MFA \nand providing a more comprehensive measure of the scale and circularity of total material and \nwaste ﬂows and their technical and ecological loop closing. For a more detailed description of \nthe diﬀerences between the traditional and extended EW-MFA approach refer to the \nEconomy-Wide Material Flow Accounting section in Annex A of the Methodology for Nations. \nConsistent with the SEEA-CF, the CGR Measurement Framework’s conceptual foundation sees the \nsocioeconomic system as being inside the environment, with ﬂows between and within the two. \nWhile the scope of this analysis is global, the framework is set up at the national level to capture \ntrade implications: that is, \nﬂows between a domestic economy and environment and other \neconomies and the non-domestic environment. This is an important layer to be considered, for \nexample, when calculating footprints and related indicators at the national level. The CGR \nMeasurement Framework introduces several key distinctions that enhance its analytical \ncapabilities: \n● Distinction between rate and scale indicators: Rate indicators at the input side \nmeasure the share of secondary (denoted with light blue in Figure one) and ecologically \ncycled (light green) materials in processed materials (de\nﬁned as primary and secondary \nmaterial inputs), and at the output side the share of technically (light blue) and \necologically (light green) cycled materials in interim outputs (deﬁned as all waste and \nemissions before recovery and recycling or discharge to the environment). The rate \nindicators measure the circularity performance—from 0% in a linear economy with \nneither technical nor ecological cycling—to 100% in a (thermodynamically unfeasible) \nperfect circular economy, where all processed materials are cycled without losses in \nloops;  \n● Distinction between technical and ecological cycling rates: Both rates are derived \nfrom the same underlying system deﬁnition and relate the respective cycled ﬂows to the \nsame reference ﬂow (i.e., to processed materials on the input side and processed \noutputs on the output side). They are, therefore, consistent, additive, mutually exclusive \nand applicable across scales. Technical cycling refers to the ﬂow of re- and down-cyclable \nend-of-life waste (output side) handled by waste management and reintroduced into the \nmarket in the form of secondary materials (input side). It also includes by-products that \nare reused before becoming waste. Ecological cycling refers to the ﬂow of renewable \nbiomass—or in our case carbon-neutral biomass—and the resulting outﬂows to the \nenvironment, which re-enter global biogeochemical cycles. Indicators related to these \nﬂows are shown in light green in Figure one; \n● Distinction between natural and anthropogenic ﬂows: Natural ﬂows are resources \n(such as raw materials extracted on the input side) or residuals (such as emissions and \nwaste discharged on the output side) that originate from or are destined to the \nenvironment. It is important to note the diﬀerence between natural (dark green in Figure \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 12 \n\n\n \none) and biological (light green) ﬂows. Natural ﬂows can comprise both biological and \npotentially renewable materials (light green) and inert non-renewable ones. On the other \nhand, anthropogenic ﬂows (grey and light blue) are of mixed composition that originate \nfrom or are destined to other socioeconomic systems. While natural ﬂows contain only \nresources, anthropogenic ﬂows can also contain man-made artefacts such as \nmanufactured and semi-manufactured products. This distinction is particularly relevant \nin the context of trade and the calculation of upstream requirements (or raw material \nequivalents) in material footprinting; \n● Distinction between ﬂows and socioeconomic stocks: Activities of the socioeconomic \nsystem are fed by ﬂows of materials from the natural environment, which are then \nprocessed by industries, and are either accumulated in physical stocks (additions to the \nstock of ﬁxed assets) or transformed and released back to the natural environment as \nresiduals. Materials stockpiled in buildings, infrastructure, and durable goods in the \neconomy (long-term materials), as well as old materials that are removed from stock as \nbuildings are demolished and durable goods disposed of (demolition and discard), are \ncaptured by the NAS indicator (dark blue). NAS measures the physical growth of the \neconomy and exposes the time lag between material consumption and waste \ngeneration, which is key to addressing circularity through strategies aimed at extending \nproduct lifetimes such as renovation, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and \nsharing. In our framework, these strategies would result in an increase of the service \nlifetime of in-use stocks and potentially a stabilisation of in-use stock growth, as indicated \nby NAS. Thus, even though we don’t have data on the prevalence of these strategies, \ntheir eﬀects can be observed through this indicator, especially in combination with \nsupporting lower-tier indicators. \nFigure one shows the structure of the CGR Measurement Framework and its link with the CIS \nheadline indicators.

Refer to the ‘Note’ following Figure one for a summary of acronyms used in this visual. \n \nAt the reporting level (MF1), DE, IMP and EXP consist of the four main resource groups: biomass, \nfossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals. IMP and EXP of goods are measured at the \nvolumes at which they cross national boundaries and typically contain products at diﬀerent \nstages of processing, including unprocessed raw materials, semi-manufactured products and \nﬁnished products. While the aggregation of DE is relatively straightforward, IMP and EXP contain \nadditional product ﬂows that consist mainly of a type of resource (‘Products mainly from’ [...]), or \neven mixed and complex products (‘Other products’), that do need to be re-assigned to the usual \nMF1-4 categories to ensure consistent totals. In the context of direct accounts and indicators, \nthese compounded products can be reallocated to diﬀerent material ﬂows based on their \nrelative shares within the resource group (as per the proportioning principle from Mayer et al. \n2018). However, this should not result in negative consumption ﬁgures due to an overly negative \nphysical trade balance (PTB). With this data, additional indicators per resource group can be \nderived including PTB and DMC. \n  and   𝑃𝑇𝐵 =  𝐼𝑀𝑃 – 𝐸𝑋𝑃 𝐷𝑀𝐶 =  𝐷𝐸 +  𝑃𝑇𝐵\nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 21 \n\n\n \nWithin the CGR Engine,the  raw material equivalents of trade (RME_IMP, RME_EXP) and the \nmaterial footprint (RMC) are covered by Module one.

Emissions to water include substances and materials released into \nnatural water systems through human activities, after or without passing wastewater treatment \n(such as materials dumped at sea).

Such accounts are built using a combination of the state-of-the-art datasets \ninternationally available (see section Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output \nAnalysis—Weavebase model in Annex A of Methodology for Nations). A speci\nﬁc extension for \nemissions from deforestation is added for use in the calculation of the ECPr and NRBr indicators \n(see Box \nﬁve: LULUCF versus deforestation in Annex A of Methodology for Nations). \n4.2.3 Gaps and limitations \nDue to the lack of comprehensive and up-to-date country-level data on minor GHGs and air \npollutants, the Weavebase model currently includes only three major ones:  carbon dioxide \n(CO2) (including from biomass combustion), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Due to the \nintegration of the EDGAR v8.0 database with the Exiobase v3.8.2 and Eora v199.82 extensions, \nthe resulting extension of Weavebase is an incoherent mix inventory (territory principle) and \naccount (resident) emission totals which needs further harmonisation. Accounting for only 1%, \nemissions to water and dissipative losses represent the smallest category in processed outputs \n(Matthews et al., 2000) and are therefore not explicitly accounted for within the CGR \nMeasurement Framework. \n4.3 Module three: Waste \nThis module consists of three sub-modules: \n● Waste generation and treatment  \n● Waste trade \n● Dissipative uses and losses \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 24 \n\n\n \nFigure four pictures a simpli\nﬁ\ned extended EW-MFA framework based on Mayer et al. (2018) with elements of \nModule three highlighted. \n \n4.3.1 Module 3.1: Waste generation and treatment \n4.3.1.1 Description \nBy deﬁnition, waste refers to materials that are of no further use to the generator for \nproduction, transformation or consumption. Waste may be generated at diﬀerent stages of the \nsupply chain, from extraction to ﬁnal use, and from both short-lived material uses (most of \nmunicipal solid waste, packaging waste or sludges and ashes from combustion) and long-lived \nmaterial uses (construction and demolition waste or discarded vehicles, for example).  \nIn the traditional EW-MFA approach, waste is only accounted for to the extent to which it is \nreleased back to the environment through open dumping, while landﬁlls are considered as a \nform of stock addition. Recycled material ﬂows are considered ﬂows within the economy (for \nexample, of metals, paper and glass) and thus are not considered as outputs (nor inputs).  \nConversely, in the extended EW-MFA approach, recycled materials (as well as other ‘internal \nﬂows’ such as by-products and reused products) are included while landﬁlls are considered to be \npart of the environment and not a form of stock addition, and are thus included as part of \nprocessed output.  \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 25 \n\n\n \nWaste generated from the treatment of waste, also referred to as secondary waste, is not \naccounted for in the context of this framework as it would translate into double counting. \nWaste from unused extraction (such as excavated earth, overburden, dredging spoils, etcetera) \nand used extraction (such as extractive ore waste, tailings, etcetera) could not be di\nﬀerentiated \ndue to data limitations. In the application of this methodological framework at the national level, \ninput-and output-side statistics are harmonised, as described Methodology for Nations. This \nharmonisation is not possible at the global level.  \nRecycled ﬂows, hereafter referred to as secondary materials (SM), refer to materials recovered \nthrough all forms of recycling including downcycling (for example, backﬁlling). Reused products \nand materials including industrial by-products are also considered secondary materials. In this \ndocument, the term ‘recycled ﬂow’ and ‘secondary materials’ are used interchangeably, as a \nstudy carried out by Eurostat48 concluded that the input to recovery plants is an acceptable proxy \nfor the output from recovery plants. However, it should be noted that there are time lags and \nineﬃciencies in the waste management system: this means that the amount of waste available \nfor recycling and the secondary materials ﬂowing into the economy in the same year are not \nnecessarily the same. The measurement framework was built upon a systems and material \nperspective of the economy, and based the assessment as far as possible on statistical data from \nnational (i.e. statistical oﬃces) and international (i.e. FAOSTAT, IRP) oﬃcial environmental \nreporting systems. While recovered materials were either reported in waste statistics or could be \ndirectly quantiﬁed, this was not possible for other circular strategies such as the extension of \nproduct lifetimes, reuse and remanufacturing, or sharing. \nTracing the transformation of materials from their extraction until their end-of-life requires the \nintegration of EW-MFA and waste statistics. The latter, however, are lacking in many countries \nand need to be estimated based on available data. One of the most comprehensive databases \non waste management is the What-a-Waste (WaW) v2.0 database by the World Bank. This was \nused as the starting point for the estimation of waste generation, collection and treatment for all \ncountries in the world. While the main advantage of this database is the wide coverage across \ncountries and indicators, the completeness and time coverage of the data points can vary greatly \nand requires extensive data-gap-\nﬁlling and extrapolation. \nOur step-by-step approach for data manipulation, including interpolation, back- and now-casting \nis the following:49 \n● Step one—Primary data collection for bottom-up corrections: This entailed desk \nresearch focused on the largest countries by waste generation (excluding EU countries, \nsee ‘Data sources’ sections). The database developed for the CGR Latin America and the \n49 Source year refers to the latest year for which reported data was available. Target year refers to the baseline year for \nwhich it was decided to estimate the indicator framework based on data availability across all databases employed in the \nanalysis. The target year for the CGR Latin America and the Caribbean is 2018. \n48 Eurostat (2018). Circular material use rate: Calculation method. Retrieved from: Eurostat website  \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 26 \n\n\n \nCaribbean50 was also included. The data collected covered municipal solid waste (MSW) \nand special waste (SW) generation, collection rates and treatment rates at the highest \nlevel of detail and for the most recent year available; \n● Step two—MSW generation nowcasting: This analysis assumes that MSW generation \ngrows primarily based on population and aﬄuence. Following the approach used by Kaza \net al. (2018),51 a regression formula based on GDP per capita was used to estimate the \ndevelopment of MSW generation per capita for each country between the source and \ntarget years. Population ﬁgures from the UN’s World Population Prospects52 were then \nused to estimate total MSW generation for the target year. If MSW data were available for \nthe target year, the original data was used; \n● Step three—SW and collection rates data interpolation: Because a lot of the regions \nhave missing data for at least one of the SW subtotals, interpolation was required. While \nthe earlier approach would interpolate within income groups, such a hard cut-oﬀ was not \nalways desirable while also reducing the bin size for low-income regions to a very small \nset of candidates. In the improved interpolation approach, spatial distance and \ndiﬀerence (distance) in GDP per capita were used instead. For EU countries, data gaps in \nEurostat’s time series were ﬁlled using basic linear interpolation. For edge data, the ﬁrst \nor last known value was used instead. Agricultural waste, entirely made of biomass, is \nconsidered as part of the ecological cycle as it is mainly returned back to the \nenvironment through soil application or burnt in open ﬁres (emissions from biomass \ncombustion). Because biomass ﬂows on both the input and output side are accounted \nfor by the ECPr indicators rather then TCr ones, agricultural waste was excluded from the \nSW dataset to avoid double counting; \n● Step four—SW generation nowcasting: This analysis assumes that SW generation \ngrows primarily based on sectoral gross output. Construction and manufacturing \nindustry output from the Eora database were matched to the corresponding physical \nwaste stream, in this case construction and demolition waste (C&DW) and industrial \nwaste, to calculate SW generation intensities for the source years (various) and multiplied \nby the historical gross sectoral output for the target year. If waste data was missing, the \nintensity factor is interpolated using the spatial/income interpolation method described \nabove; \n● Step ﬁve—Treatment rates nowcasting: For each country, treatment rates for a source \nyear were gathered. Time series of gross output for waste treatment sectors were \n52 UN World Population Prospect 2019 extracted from File POP/1-1: Total population (both sexes combined) by region, \nsubregion and country, annually for 1950–2100 (unit: thousands of people). \n51 Kaza, Silpa; Yao, Lisa C.; Bhada-Tata, Perinaz; Van Woerden, Frank. 2018.

Retrieved from: CGRi website \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 27 \n\n\n \ngathered from the Input-Output database Exiobase v3.8.2.53 Based on the source year for \nwhich mass-based waste treatment rates were available, (monetary-based) scaling \nfactors were calculated as the ratio between gross output of the waste treatment sectors \nin the source and target year. Matching tables of WaW treatment types and countries to \nExiobase waste treatment sectors and regions were developed, and the monetary-based \nscaling factors were used to scale the mass-based waste treatment rates. For instance, if \nthe aggregated gross output of all re-processing sectors of a country in Exiobase \nincreased by 10% between the source and target year (i.e. a scaling factor of 1.1), then \nthe recycling rate also increased by 10%. After applying the nowcasting factor, the waste \ntreatment rates were renormalised to sum to 100%. Waste treatment types that do not \nhave a relevant waste sector proxy were ignored (for example,uncontrolled waste \ndisposal). Note that this approach assumes full linearity between the monetary gross \noutput of a waste treatment sector and the physical volume treated by the same. This \nassumption was not empirically tested. Furthermore, for many non-OECD countries with \nlacking data, treatment rates for MSW were applied to SW fractions under the \nassumptions that the two types of waste were treated alike. Finally, within the context of \nthis framework, rates for anaerobic digestion and composting were not included since \norganic waste \nﬂows (such as agricultural waste, food waste, etcetera) are accounted for \nby the input and output ECPr rather than the input and output TCr; \n● Step six—Top-down consolidation: Results from the CGR Engine were benchmarked \nagainst those from the MISO v.1 model. Datasets from two publications using the same \ninput data are used: A time series (1900-2015) of DE, Material use, NAS and DPO by \nKraussman et al. (2018)54 and projections of stock-related variables, i.e. primary and \nsecondary stock-building materials, end-of-life waste from stocks and ﬁnal waste after \nrecycling by Wiedenhofer et al. (2019).55 The two datasets are combined to get a \nconsistent time series for key variables up to 2021 and the ratio of demolition and \ndiscard (calculated as GAS - NAS) to the DMC of non-metallic minerals estimated. This \nratio is a proxy for the average relationship between the in\nﬂow of stock-building \nconstruction materials and the amount of C&DW generated and it is used as a model \nconstraint for the calibration of C&DW estimates (including that which is destined to \nrecycling). For each country and year, the ratio between the DMC of non-metallic \nminerals and C&DW has to be equal or higher than the global average. This constraint is \nnot applied to the countries with bottom-up corrections for the amount of C&DW. \n \nThe generalised formula for the calculation of waste treated volumes is the following: \n55 Wiedenhofer, D., Fishman, T., Lauk, C., Haas, W., & Krausmann, F.

The database mainly focuses on MSW, which includes \nresidential, commercial and institutional waste. SW, which encompasses industrial, medical, \nhazardous, electronic, and C&DW is also compiled to the extent possible. Actual values rather \nthan estimates or projections are prioritised, even if it requires the use of older data. The data \nreported are predominantly from 2011 to 2017, although overall data span about two decades. \nWithin a single country, data availability may cut across several years. Furthermore, when a year \nrange is reported in the original source, the \nﬁnal year of the range is provided in this document’s \ndata set. Overall, this translates into highly fragmented and heterogeneous data points from a \ntemporal perspective. Waste collection coverage data are reported according to multiple \ndeﬁnitions: amount of waste collected, number of households served, population served or \ngeographic area covered. Waste treatment and disposal includes recycling, composting, \nanaerobic digestion, incineration, landﬁlling, open dumping and dumping in marine areas or \nwaterways. Given the variability of types of landﬁlls used, data were collected for three types of \nlandﬁlls: sanitary landﬁlls with landﬁll gas collection systems, controlled landﬁlls that are \nengineered but for which landﬁll gas collection systems do not exist or are unknown, and \nuncategorised landﬁlls. In cases where disposal and treatment percentages did not add up to \n100% or where a portion of waste is uncollected, the remaining amount was categorised as \nwaste ‘unaccounted for.’ Waste not accounted for by formal disposal methods, such as landﬁlls \nor recycling, was assumed to be dumped. Waste that is disposed of in waterways and that is \nmanaged in low- and middle-income countries in ‘other’ manners was also assumed to be \ndumped. Reported collection and treatment rates refer to MSW only. \nThe OECD data explorer56 57 was used as the main source for up-to-date MSW and hazardous \nwaste data. Eurostat was used to update EU countries with great accuracy. For SW, waste \ngeneration data was sourced from env_was_gen.58 Waste treatment rates were calculated from \nthe env_was_trt dataset which grants more control than the env_wasoper dataset over waste \nstream to be included. For MSW, the env_wasmun59 dataset was used instead. Both generated \n59 Eurostat. (2025). Municipal waste generation and treatment (Data code: env_wasmun).

The main limitations and avenues for future improvement are listed \nbelow: \n● The choice of gross output—and more generally, monetary data—to extrapolate SW has \nmany shortcomings: for example, the exclusion of waste generation by the informal \neconomy and the overestimation of waste generation for geographically small countries \nwith high GDP. C&DW could be better estimated using a dynamic stock and \nﬂow model; \n● For EU countries, the application of a standard approach to the calculation of volumes of \ntreated waste treatment rates (i.e. multiplication of waste generation with treatment \nrates) results in discrepancies in overall volumes of waste treated between the engine \nand env_wastrt. Moreover, for EU countries treatment rates are calculated ‘at the \ntreatment facility gates’, thus including imported and excluded exported waste, while \nwaste generated is just that produced within territorial borders (excluding imported and \nincluding exported waste). For non EU countries, this information is not available and \nthus this eﬀect remains unknown;  \n● The application of the same collection and treatment rates for MSW and SW could be \nimproved by the use of speciﬁc rates for each type for all countries; \n● The use of waste treatment sectors’ gross monetary output for the development of \nscaling factors could be improved by the selection of a more speci\nﬁc factor such as \ninvestment in waste treatment technologies. \nWhile recovered materials were either reported in waste statistics or could be directly quantiﬁed, \nthis was not possible for other circular strategies such as the extension of product lifetimes, \nrefurbishment, remanufacturing, or sharing. As already mentioned in the CGR Measurement \nFramework, these strategies would result in an increase of the service lifetime of in-use stocks \nand potentially a stabilisation of in-use stock growth, as indicated by the NAS. Thus, even though \nthese strategies are di\nﬃcult to measure directly, their eﬀects on the size of inﬂows, additions to \nstock, and outﬂows can be substantial and are observable via the CGR Measurement Framework . \n80 Set as a weighted average between the C&D recycling rate from: US EPA.

When adjusting the amounts of recycled waste in treatment operations by \nimports and exports of secondary materials, the country that uses the secondary material gets \nthe 'credit' for contributing to the worldwide saving of primary raw materials. This perspective is \ncloser to the national accounts' logic in which most re-attributions are directed towards ﬁnal use.  \nFor more extensive information on trade in secondary materials and how this inﬂuences the \nITCr, refer to Box three in Methodology for Nations. \n4.3.2.2 Data sources \nTo calculate the amounts of imported and exported waste and by-products, Eurostat has \nidentiﬁed a list of Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes that can be considered as such.81 82 For \napplication to non-EU countries, Circle Economy has developed a mapping table between the CN \nand Harmonised System (HS) classiﬁcation that replicates this methodology on international \nbilateral trade databases such as BACI.83 \n4.3.2.3 Gaps and limitations \nDue to the lack of available statistics, domestic use and trade of reused goods as well as other \ntypes of ‘inner ﬂows’ such on-site recycling is currently poorly or not at all captured in the \nanalysis. Furthermore, while trade in by-products can be estimated from international trade \ndatabases, the production for domestic use of by-products is missing. At the country-level this \ncan result in an overly negative consumption of by-products due to the lack of the ‘domestic’ \ncomponent and, in some cases, overall negative consumption of secondary materials. \n4.3.3 Module 3.3: Dissipative uses and losses \n4.3.3.1 Description \nSome materials—such as manure, fertilisers or sewage sludge—are deliberately dissipated into \nthe environment because dispersal is an inherent quality of product use or quality and cannot be \navoided.84 The explicit accounting of these ﬂows is only relevant in the context of the traditional \napproach while in the extended one they are estimated as a residual item within processed \n84 Matthews, E., Amann, C., Bringezu, S., Fischer-Kowalski, M., Hüttler, W., Kleijn, R., ... & Weisz, H.

(2018) with elements of \nModule four highlighted. \n \n4.4.1 Description \nAlthough bulk water and air ﬂows are excluded from EW-MFA, material transformations during \nprocessing may involve water and air exchanges which signiﬁcantly aﬀect the mass balance. \nBalancing items (BIs) are estimations of these ﬂows, which are not part of DE, DPO or NAS, \nbecause they are not included in their deﬁnitions. BIs mostly refer to the oxygen demand of \nvarious combustion processes (both technical and biological ones), water vapour from biological \nrespiration, and from the combustion of fossil fuels containing water and/or other hydrogen \ncompounds. In the compilation of these \nﬂows, only a few quantitatively important processes are \ntaken into account and the ﬂows are estimated using generalised stoichiometric equations. The \nexplicit accounting of these ﬂows is only relevant in the context of the traditional approach, while \nin the extended approach, inﬂows and outﬂows are inherently estimated at the net of the BIs. In \nthe traditional approach, their inclusion is extremely important for an accurate estimation of \nNAS. The inclusion/exclusion of BIs as well as the di\nﬀerent approach to the closure of mass \nbalance and the estimation of NAS are the main distinctions between the traditional and the \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 34 \n\n\n \nextended EW-MFA approach. This can be best observed by comparing the mass balancing \nformulas of the two approaches (see Table three). \n 𝑁𝐴𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑑 = 𝐷𝑀𝐶 +  𝐵𝐼 𝑖𝑛 − 𝐵𝐼𝑜𝑢𝑡 − 𝐷𝑃𝑂\n  𝑁𝐴𝑆𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 𝐺𝐴𝑆 −  𝐷&𝐷\n 𝐺𝐴𝑆 =  𝑃𝑀 *  𝑚𝑈𝑠𝑒_𝑠𝑡𝑘\n 𝐷&𝐷 =  𝑊_𝑚𝑈𝑠𝑒 −  (𝑚𝑈𝑠𝑒 − 𝐺𝐴𝑆 −  𝑊𝑢 𝑚𝑈𝑠𝑒)\nFor more extensive information on the elements in this module refer to section Module four: \nMaterial balance and stock accounts of the CGR Latin America and the Caribbean methodology \ndocument. \n4.4.2 Data sources \nDue to the diﬀerent nature of the calculations between the traditional and extended approach, \nthe data sources are also diﬀerent. In the traditional approach, BIs are calculated using FAOSTAT \nQCL and the UN population prospects datasets for items related to livestock and human \nrespiration while those related to combustion processes and water content are estimated using \nDMC derived from the IRP’s TCCC dataset. NAS is estimated as the residual BI. In the extended \nMFA approach, instead, the estimation of GAS and demolition and discard is based on variety of \nsources: PM derived from the IRP’s TCCC dataset and secondary materials from Module three: \nWaste, material and energy use coe\nﬃcients based on Mayer et al. (2018), waste composition \nshares from Haas et al. (2020), FAOSTAT food balances, and UNSTAT energy balances. \n4.4.3. Gaps and limitations \nFor the traditional approach, only the most important BIs are calculated representing about 90% \nof the total (based on EU countries data) for both the input- and output-side. \nFor the extended approach, even though it measures ﬂow at the net of the BIs,  a number of \ngaps and limitations should be considered. Although these limitations cut across several \nmodules, it was decided that they should be grouped here as they all converge into the \nestimation of NAS : \n● An integral application of the extended MFA approach would require the conversion of \nmetal ores from DE into metal content and extractive waste (tailings). Extractive waste \nshould then be directly ascribed to interim output while the material use of metals \nshould be expressed in metal content. Currently, all ﬂows are instead expressed as metal \nores, therefore signiﬁcantly inﬂating the size of the metal ores resource group across all \nindicators; \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 35 \n\n\n \n● Proxy values from Haas et al. (2020) for the composition of waste ﬂows are applied to all \ncurrent waste streams. These shares are based on the composition of the ’discard and \ndemolition’ ﬂow for the year 2015. Therefore, these compositions do not consider waste \ngenerated by short-lived products and dissipative losses (‘dissipative losses and \nprocessing waste’ in the Haas et al. (2020) model) as this would lead to an overestimation \nof the biomass fraction. We make an exception for metal ores, for which ‘dissipative \nlosses and processing waste’ are included, since extractive waste (tailings) is directly \nascribed to interim outputs and the metals in ’discard and demolition’ are expressed in \nmetal content while tailings are—in theory—included in the engine’s waste treatment \ndata; \n● Waste from energy use largely constitutes animal and food waste, and in a smaller part, \ncombustion waste and sludges. Since manure, crop-residues and the composted share \nof MSW are not included in the waste treatment data from the WaW database (and \nbottom-up corrections), in this simpliﬁed approach we assume that all waste from the \nWaW database (and bottom-up corrections) recorded in the engine originates from \nmaterial use. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 36 \n\n\n \n5. THE WAY FORWARD \nAs the CGR Measurement Framework continues to evolve, several key areas require further \ndevelopment and reﬁnement. These improvements will enhance the comprehensiveness, \naccuracy, and applicability of the methodology, ensuring that it remains a reliable tool for \nassessing global circularity. The key areas of improvement can be grouped into three categories: \nthe implementation of the conceptual framework, the measurement framework, and the CIS. \n5.1 Enhance the conceptual framework \nImplementing the conceptual framework in line with the CES Guidelines: The current CIS \nscope primarily focuses on the material dimension of the circular economy, speciﬁcally the \naspect of ‘Material life cycles and value chains’. To fully implement the conceptual framework in \nline with the CES Guidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: Conceptual Framework, \nIndicators and Measurement Framework, additional dimensions will need to be integrated—such \nas environmental impacts, employment, and ﬁnancial aspects. The expansion will follow a similar \napproach to that used for the ‘Material life cycles and value chains’ aspect: \n● Step 1: Evaluate the indicators proposed in the CES Guidelines for other circular economy \naspects—‘Interactions with the environment’, ‘Responses and actions’, and \n‘Socioeconomic opportunities’. This assessment will consider criteria such as relevance \nand measurability to select the most appropriate indicators for inclusion in the CIS. \nIndicators identiﬁed as ‘core’ in the Guidelines will be treated as highly relevant by \ndefault. \n● Step 2: Identify alternative indicators for areas marked in the CES Guidelines as \n‘placeholders’ or where the most relevant indicators are yet to be de\nﬁned. This includes \nincorporating as complementary or substitute indicators, including metrics, such as: \n○ The number of direct and indirect circular jobs, measured using the Circular Job \nAnalysis approach developed by Circle Economy and UNEP, with an update \ncurrently in development with ILO-WB;87 \n○ The amount of investments in circular activities or businesses, as guided by the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC)—which assessed the landscape of \nsustainable \nﬁnance and streamlined various existing frameworks into a simpliﬁed \nguideline for classifying circular investments88—and ﬁrst measured by Circle \nEconomy in the Circularity Gap Report Finance.89 \n89 Circle Economy. (2025). The circularity gap report ﬁnance. Retrieved from: CGR website  \n88 IFC Harmonised Circular Economy Finance Guidelines, to be published Q4 2025.  \n87 Muñoz H, M. E., Novak, M., Gil, S., Dufourmont, J., Goodwin Brown, E., Conﬁado, A., & Nelemans, M. (2022). Tracking a \ncircular economy transition through jobsCircular Economy Transition Through Jobs: Method development and \napplication in two citiesDevelopment and Application in Two Cities. Frontiers in Sustainable Cities, 3, 787076. \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 37 \n\n\n \n●  Step 3: For the selected long-list of ideal indicators, identify data sources and/or \ncalculation methods. Where no suitable source or method exists, the indicator will be \nretained as a reference, and a placeholder will be proposed. This process will be iterative, \nleading to the development of: \n○ A long-list of ideal indicators, and \n○ A short-list of suitable indicators for implementation. \n● Step 4 (Optional): As with the ‘Material life cycles and value chains’ aspect, develop \nheadline indicators for the new dimensions. This may involve techniques such as \nnormalisation or weighting to enable comparability and integration across aspects. \nStrengthening Tier two and Tier three Indicators: Due to existing data limitations, certain \ncomplementary (Tier two) and contextual (Tier three) indicators are absent or temporarily \nreplaced with proxies in the CGR 2025. Developing a more systematic approach for integrating \nlower-tier indicators will improve the framework’s analytical depth and applicability. \n5.2 Reﬁning the measurement framework \nImplementing country-level extended MFA: A critical improvement is the full application of \nthe extended MFA approach at the country level. This requires higher-resolution data to \ndi\nﬀerentiate waste streams by origin (material versus energy use) and composition. Additionally, \nimproving the tracking of energy carriers (for example, moving from energy balances to Physical \nEnergy Flow Accounts) and reconciling traditional and extended MFA results through \noptimisation algorithms will enhance accuracy. \nAdvancing Module three: Waste: Given the complexity and data scarcity in waste tracking, the \nwaste module remains a priority for improvement. The following aspects require attention: \n● Quantifying waste from unused domestic extraction: This is essential for harmonising \ninput- and output-side statistical data collection; \n● Improving coverage of waste generation and treatment data: Many data-scarce countries \ncurrently assume that MSW treatment rates apply to all solid waste streams, leading to \ninaccuracies. Developing bottom-up corrections or systematic estimations will enhance \nprecision; \n● Addressing inconsistencies in waste treatment rate calculations: Existing datasets often \nrecord waste treatment rates under di\nﬀerent principles, leading to potential \noverestimations (such as in EU countries) or underestimations elsewhere. A structured \nevaluation and correction process is necessary. \nReducing dependence on model constraints: Gradual reﬁnement of the framework, including \nthe adoption of the MISO v2 model, will eventually eliminate the need for top-down constraints \nthat align results with global models. \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 38 \n\n\n \nAccounting for by-products and reused products: Improved estimation techniques and the \nintegration of new datasets will allow for more precise accounting of domestic and traded \nby-products and reused materials. \n5.3 Strengthening the Circularity Indicator Set \nImproving representation of waste management processes: The current EW-MFA framework \nassumes that materials available for recycling directly translate into secondary materials used in \nthe market. This simpliﬁcation ignores sorting and processing losses and does not diﬀerentiate \nbetween diﬀerent end-of-life waste age cohorts. Increasing the level of detail in the waste \nmanagement process will signiﬁcantly improve stock-ﬂow dynamics representation. \nDeveloping criteria for sustainable biomass management: Establishing clear input- and \noutput-side criteria for deﬁning sustainably managed and regenerative biomass will enhance \nmeasurement accuracy. This will involve identifying relevant datasets (such as certiﬁcation \nschemes) or methodologies (such as Substance Flow Analysis) that support the assessment of \nsustainability in biomass use. \nResolving the ‘net extraction abroad (NEA) issue’ in national circularity assessments: \nCountry-level circularity results can be calculated using either DMC or RMC. While RMC better \nreﬂects a country's material extraction pressure, its application to the CIS is complex due to \nunresolved methodological challenges (see section ‘NEA issue’ in Appendix A of Methodology for \nNations). Addressing this remains a key priority. \n \n \n \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 39 \n\n\ncircle-economy.com\n\n",

Natural resource \nmanagement and global material use trends \nare moving in the wrong direction: material \nextraction and waste generation are trending \nupwards, while recycling and controlled \ndisposal rates are both trending downwards \nover a five-year period. What’s more, official, \nscience-based global material use targets are \nlacking, making it difficult to drive progress.\nIn an ideal world, \nwe use as many secondary materials as possible \nwhile minimising extraction and consumption. \nIndustries have embraced principles of material \nefficiency and sufficiency, prioritising the use \nof recycled inputs alongside circular design \nprinciples. Material recovery from long-lived \nstocks—such as buildings and infrastructure, \nwhich can act as ‘banks’ of materials for \nreuse—has been optimised. At the same time, \ncountries have vastly improved waste collection, \nprocessing and recycling and have minimised \nwaste from extraction processes.\nThe Circularity Metric continues to \ndecline: the vast majority of materials \nentering the economy are virgin, with \nthe share of secondary materials \nfalling from 7.2% to 6.9% as of the \nlatest analysis. \nOngoing declines in circularity can largely be tied \nto sustained growth in material use. Although the \nabsolute scale of secondary material consumption \nis slowly trending upwards, this is being outpaced \nby growth in virgin material use. Global extraction \nhas more than tripled in the last fifty years, recently \nreaching a landmark 100 billion tonnes—and without \n‘bending the trend’, this is set to rise by a further  \n60% by 2060.\n2 \nA truly circular economy should be resource-light: \nwithout profoundly rewiring systems of production \nand consumption and applying structural changes \nacross key systems—from housing and food to \nmobility and manufacturing—we will not be able to \nclose the loop on material consumption. At the same \ntime, there is a significant opportunity to bolster \nthe Circularity Metric by recycling all the materials \nthat potentially could\n3 be cycled but currently aren’t. \nVirgin, Non-Renewable Materials destined for \nlandfill—including heavy industrial wastes, short-\nlived consumer products, and end-of-life vehicles or \nconstruction materials—account for nearly one-fifth \n(18.1%) of global material inputs. This represents huge \nuntapped potential: if we were to recycle all waste \ncurrently not being recycled without  reducing overall \nmaterial use, for example, the Circularity Metric would \ngrow to approximately 25%. \nThere is potential to boost circularity by better-\nmanaging construction and demolition waste, as well \nas smaller waste streams, like municipal solid waste. \nHowever, a good portion of Virgin, Non-Renewable \nMaterials are hard-to-recycle, lower-value waste types, \nfrom waste rock to soils, underscoring the importance \nof rolling out circular strategies that minimise waste \nfrom the outset while prioritising high-value reuse and \nrecycling where possible. \n \n11\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

However, all \nbiomass extraction comes with numerous uncaptured \nenvironmental impacts. Although renewable, biomass \nisn’t sustainable by default, and carbon neutrality is \nonly a partial criterion for quantifying its circularity. \nBy only considering this aspect, we can’t account for \nthe loss of ecological complexity and biodiversity \nthat biomass extraction may cause—for example, \nlarge-scale monoculture plantations can deplete soil \nnutrients, reduce habitat diversity, and contribute to \ndeforestation, threatening ecosystems and species.  \nIt is not currently possible to measure other important \ncriteria for circular biomass, such as whether nutrients \nare safely returned to the biosphere in the right place \nand at the right rate. For this reason, even Carbon-\nNeutral Biomass should be considered carefully and \nwith nuance. Though Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass \naccounts for just 2.2% of material inputs, it represents \napproximately one-tenth of total biomass use—still a \ncrucial share to minimise. \nDespite its declining share in global material \nextraction, the scale of biomass extraction has more \nthan doubled in the last half-century, driving land-\nuse change and biodiversity loss and accounting for \na significant portion of global emissions. Developing \na more circular economy will require a rebalancing of \nglobal land use: currently, a disproportionate share of \nthe planet’s land is used for agriculture—particularly \nfor pasture and feed crops. Transforming our food \nsystems towards circular, regenerative practices \nand plant-based, unprocessed diets will be critical to \nreducing these pressures and restoring ecosystems.\nThe verdict  \nWe’re making some progress, but more  \nmust be done to help meet global targets. \nGlobal biomass extraction and other key \nindicators—water stress, for example—are \ntrending upwards, while the share of forested \nland is decreasing. While we are making \nprogress at safely treating wastewater and \nbolstering land protection, progress isn’t \nhappening at the speed and scope needed to \nmeet global climate and biodiversity targets. \nWithout accelerated action, ecosystems \nmay struggle to sustain the industries and \ncommunities that depend on them.\nIn an ideal world, \nwe’ve reduced the land footprint intensity \nof biomass production and use biomass in \na way that respects natural cycles—such as \nthe carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water \ncycles—prevents the harmful transformation  \nof land, nurtures biodiversity and soil health, \nand maximises value through cascading  \nwhere possible.\n*  A much smaller share of biomass is captured by other indicators, \nmaking its way into the technical cycle and contributing to the \nCircularity Metric, Virgin, Non-Renewable Materials destined for \ndisposal, or Net Additions to Stock.\n12\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

This report aims \nto do just this: building on years of experience \ncalculating the Circularity Metric, it now opens up \nthe Circularity Gap. It recognises that although \nthe Metric has been useful in providing a global \nbaseline for circularity, it is only one piece of \na large and complex puzzle. This year’s edition \nprovides a comprehensive ‘report card’ on the \nstate of the global circular economy. It quantifies \na dashboard of indicators to ground abstract \nconcepts in reality, spark action, pinpoint where \ntargets are missing, and provide a jumping-off \npoint for decision-makers and advisors across \ngovernment and industry to take action.\n1 Introduction\n16\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

In 2025, the situation is unchanged. \nThe latest Global Resources Outlook  paints a sobering \npicture of trends in natural resource use, showing that \nglobal material extraction has more than tripled in the \nlast fifty years. We have now surpassed a landmark \nof 100 billion tonnes of material extraction per year. \nThe global population has not grown at the same \nrate, showing that this has only played a partial role \nin spiralling material consumption. Instead, per capita \nconsumption has swelled from 8.4 tonnes in 1970 to \n12.2 tonnes in 2020, fuelled by urbanisation, growing \nGDP and increased affluence. This unfettered growth \nisn’t set to slow—without deep, systematic changes \nto the way the global economy operates, material \nextraction is set to rise by 60% (compared to a 2020 \nbaseline) by 2060.\n11\nAlthough material consumption has been \ninstrumental in raising living standards over the past \ncentury, we’ve now passed the point of diminishing \nreturns in many parts of the world. The current \nscale of global resource use is the main driver of the \ntriple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity \nloss and pollution, with material extraction and \nuse driving around two-thirds of greenhouse gas \nemissions and over 90% of total biodiversity loss \nand water stress, for example.\n12 As of 2023, we’ve \nalso surpassed six of the nine planetary boundaries \nvital to life on this planet.\n13 Business as usual simply \ncannot continue if we’re to achieve global climate, \nbiodiversity, and pollution targets and protect and \npreserve Earth’s life support system.\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\nYear\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\nGlobal material extraction (Gt)\nOther biomass\nOther fossil fuels\nOther metal ores\nOther non-metallic minerals\nCrop residues\nCrops\nGrazed biomass and fodder crops\nCoal\nNatural gas\nPetroleum\nCopper ore concentrates and compounds\nGold ore concentrates and compounds\nIron ore concentrates and compounds\nLimestone\nSand gravel and crushed rock for construction\nStructural clays\nCircle Economy - CGR® 2025\nFigure one portrays the evolution of global material extraction from 1970 to 2023 by \nmain material group, as well as the top materials driving this growth.\n17\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

      "content": "The widening chasm of resource \ndistribution\nExponential growth in resource consumption hasn’t \nbeen evenly distributed around the globe: high-\nincome countries have a per capita material footprint \nsix times that of lower-income countries—24 tonnes \ncompared to 4 tonnes.\n14 At the same time, high-\nincome countries represent less than one-fifth of \nthe global population, with the EU and US alone \nconsuming more than half the world’s materials \nwhile housing 10% of the world’s population.\n15 Much \nof this material use can be attributed to the build-up \nof infrastructure and capital equipment, as well as \nhigher consumption among citizens in upper-middle \nand high-income countries.\n16 However, beyond a \ncertain point, increasing material consumption \ndoes not necessarily translate to greater well-being: \nmany high-income countries have already reached a \nsaturation point, where further increases in resource \nuse lead to diminishing returns in terms of human \ndevelopment gains (see Figure two). Striking a \nbalance between resource consumption and \nhuman development is crucial.\nAt the same time, material consumption has driven \nenvironmental degradation in countries with fewer \nmeans to mitigate these impacts: per capita, higher-\nincome countries are responsible for ten times the \nclimate impacts of lower-income countries.\n17 Lower-\nincome countries bear the brunt of the consequences, \nwith climate-related natural disasters increasing \neight-fold in the last decade compared to 1980 levels.\n18 \nReducing inequality both between and within nations \nwill be key to tackling the triple planetary crisis: in \nthe process of achieving the estimated ‘sustainable’ \nlevel of consumption—8 tonnes per capita—that has \nserved as a benchmark throughout past Circularity \nGap analyses, higher-income countries will need to \ndrastically reduce their consumption while lower-\nincome countries can increase consumption to build \nup necessary service provisioning (renewable energy \ninfrastructure and sustainable housing, for example).\n19\nFigure two shows the \nrelationship between raw \nmaterial consumption \nper capita (2021) and \nthe Human Development \nIndex (HDI) (2022).\n0\n8\n20\n50\nRaw material consumption per capita (tonnes/capita)\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nHuman development index\nHigh HDI\nVery high HDI\nGSD Target\nCircle Economy - CGR® 2025\n18\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

      "content": "The circular economy as a means to \nan end\nThe circular economy, a toolbox of strategies \nand solutions that rethink and optimise how we \nconsume materials, can deliver wellbeing for all while \npreserving the environment and ecosystem services \nthat underpin a functioning economy, including \nclean air, water, natural spaces and biodiversity. \nImagine the circular economy as a way to rewire how \nan economy operates physically: it reduces physical \nthroughputs—and thus environmental impacts—by \noptimising the transformation of resources into \nsocietal needs that contribute to human well-being, \nsuch as housing, mobility and nutrition. \nWe know what the circular economy has to offer: \nthe Circularity Gap Report 2023 found that we can \nreverse the overshoot of planetary limits while \nproviding for similar needs with just 70% of the \nmaterials we use now.\n20 This would mean reducing \nyearly material consumption to around 8.5 tonnes \nper capita, approximately equal to the weight of \ntwo adult elephants, for example. This is roughly \non par with 1970s figures. While this may still seem \nlike quite a lot, it’s important to remember that per \ncapita consumption averages include far more than \nan individual’s yearly purchases and take into account \nthe construction of buildings, infrastructure and \nequipment, just to name a few. \nCrucially, the linear economy wasn’t created by \nchance—it was designed. The activities supporting \nthe unsustainable, linear production and \nconsumption patterns driving the mismanagement \nof natural resources are deeply rooted in our existing \nsystem. To successfully transition to a circular \neconomy, we need to change the rules of the game. \nFundamentally, this requires a shift in behaviours, \nnorms and belief systems, as well as dismantling \nthe tangled web of laws, regulations and policies \nthat allow for—and often incentivise—boundless \nextraction, emissions, and waste. \nStakeholders, including governments and \nbusinesses, have a crucial role to play in \ngenerating momentum for the circular \ntransition and creating the necessary \nmarket conditions for industry to shift \naway from business as usual. This could \nmean levelling the playing field through \nregulations, taxes, and subsidies, as well \nas directly supporting, procuring and \nadvocating for low-carbon, resource-\nefficient energy technologies, circular \nand regenerative farming practices, \nand high-value waste management \ninfrastructure, for example. At the \nsame time, businesses have much to \ngain by not waiting for regulations to \nchange their practices. By proactively \napplying circular economy solutions in \nprocurement, product and service design, \noperations, and waste management, \nbusinesses can mitigate resource risks, \nfrom supply chain disruptions and price \nvolatility to legislative pressure and \nreputational risks.\n21 What’s more, circular \nproducts and services allow businesses to \nincrease brand value, increase customer \nengagement and loyalty, enter new \nmarkets, cut costs and stay ahead of the \ncompetition in terms of innovation.\n19\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

      "content": "Measuring the circular economy\nTo deliver on the circular economy’s potential, we \nneed an effective means to measure how materials \nare being used at the global level. This provides \na solid evidence base for local, national and \ninternational changemakers from which to measure \nand monitor progress. Such oversight is crucial in \nrevealing the true extent and impact of material \nmismanagement, helping policymakers pinpoint \nwhere changes are needed most and helping \nindustries set benchmarks and baselines to start \nmonitoring progress. A more detailed, multifaceted \nunderstanding of circularity can bridge gaps between \nhigh-level policies and practical, impactful changes \nacross industries, moving us closer to a sustainable, \ninclusive and regenerative economy. The upcoming \nGlobal Circularity Protocol  for businesses, for \nexample, will play a key role in establishing a shared \nframework for this effort, ensuring consistency \nin how circularity is tracked and compared across \nregions and industries.\nWe cannot recycle our way out of the current linear \neconomy: regardless of how efficiently we use \nmaterials and recycle them at end-of-life, the sheer \nscale of current material extraction is unsupportable \nfor a healthy and safe planet. This underscores the \nneed to first and foremost focus on the absolute \nscales of extracted materials alongside relative \nrates. As long as extraction continues to increase, \nincremental improvements in slowing, regenerating \nand cycling material flows will not be able to offset \nthe significant environmental impacts to come. This \nprinciple is illustrated by the Circularity Metric, which \nhas fallen year on year since Circle Economy first \nbegan measuring, despite gradual increases in the \nscale of secondary material use. \nLooking at rates—like the Circularity Metric—as \nopposed to scales alone gives us insight into how \nquickly resource stocks are depleted and waste is \ngenerated, which signals how quickly environmental \npressures are building. By monitoring how these \nrates change over time, we can identify trends \nin resource efficiency and sufficiency, pinpoint \nopportunities to decouple wellbeing from material \nconsumption and gauge circular progress. This \ndual focus on both absolute figures and relative \nrates is essential to build resilience and shape an \nenvironmentally responsible global economy.\nThe legacy of the global Circularity \nGap Reports: Updating the \ncircularity metric and expanding \nour dashboard of indicators\nThe circular economy agenda has come a long way—\nparticularly regarding monitoring—since the launch \nof our first Circularity Gap Report  in 2018. Our Reports \nhave taken a system-wide perspective to monitor \nand measure the global circular economy. We have \nhistorically reported on the Circularity Metric, which \nmeasures the proportion of secondary material \nconsumption out of total material consumption \nfor an economy. This is an important indicator for \nmeasuring the circular state of an economy. However, \nthis Metric is just one part of a broader picture.\nFor this reason, the Circularity Gap Report 2025 aims \nto provide a comprehensive report on the state \nof the global circular economy , with the view that \nthe Circularity Metric—while important—is only one \npiece of a large and complex puzzle. This report \naims to provide more detail and support practical \ndecision-making by opening up the Circularity ‘Gap’.\nThis report presents and builds on the Circularity \nIndicator Set, a dashboard of 11 indicators \nthat provide a ‘report card’ for global material \ncircularity. Collectively, the Indicator Set examines \nthe relationships between resources we take from \nnature, how we use them, and their impact on the \nenvironment. Represented as shares that add up to \n100% of material inputs and 100% of outputs such \nas waste, emissions, and recycled materials, these \nindicators can be viewed as ‘levers’ to improve the \nCircularity Metric. By reducing indicators that capture \nlinear processes—such as disposing of materials \nwithout recovery or combusting fossil fuels for \nenergy—we have room for the Metric’s share to grow.\nThe Circularity Indicator Set lends itself well to \nintegration with other leading indicator frameworks \nfor the circular economy: the ISO/DIS standard\n22 and \nthe Conference of European Statisticians Guidelines \nfor Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: Conceptual \nFramework, Indicators and Measurement Framework .\n23 \n20\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

These are elaborated upon \nthrough more than 20 other leading indicators—\nglobal statistics on waste collection and recycling, \nenergy consumption and land protection, for \nexample. This can help leaders and decision-\nmakers decide where to focus and enact circular \nsolutions that are in alignment with the ultimate \ngoal of improving wellbeing within environmental \nlimits. The result is a cohesive and comprehensive \nframework suitable for many aims: the headline \nindicators, for example, are helpful for raising \nawareness and communicating circular progress \nat a high level, while lower-tier indicators can \nprovide government officials, policy analysts \nand other more technical stakeholders with the \nin-depth information needed to support decision \nmaking and agenda setting.\nThis analysis has a global scope. However, the \nmeasurement framework can be set up at the  \n(multi- and sub-)national level to account for trade  \nand the movement of materials between nations  \nfor both production and consumption. At the level  \nof businesses and industries, the scope and \nconsequent data collection should be aligned \nto operations and the relevant aspects of the \nsupply chain, whether regional or multinational.\n24 \nThe Circularity Indicator Set can be used as a \nbenchmark and reference if these differences in \nscope are considered during interpretation. \nThis year, the Circularity Gap Report  provides a \nglobal benchmark for circularity on a range of \ndimensions relevant to both governments and \nbusinesses. Through this report, governments \nand businesses can gain an understanding of \nthe global state of circularity and the risks of \ncontinuing along a linear path.\n21\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

      "content": "The circular economy is a means for delivering \nwellbeing within planetary boundaries—but \nhow can we take meaningful steps towards \ndismantling entrenched processes and rewire \nthe way we relate to the material world? This \nchapter opens up the Circularity Metric (6.9%) and \nCircularity Gap (the remaining 93.1%), exploring \n11 headline indicators and 23 sub-indicators for \ncircularity. It quantifies how materials flow in \nand out of the global economy and clarifies how \nvarious levers can be pulled to boost circularity. \nThe data reveals a troubling truth: progress is \nunderway in some areas, but negative trends are \noffsetting improvements. Secondary material \nuse, for example, has increased—from 7.1 billion \ntonnes in 2018 to 7.3 billion tonnes in 2021—but \nthe Circularity Metric continues to fall due to rapid \ngrowth in material extraction across the board.  \nAt the same time, the scale of Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials disposed of without \nrecovery has risen: these are materials that could \ncontribute to the Circularity Metric but currently \naren’t. The absolute scale of biomass extraction, \nfossil fuel use and net additions to stocks have \nall risen between 2018 and 2021 despite rates \nremaining relatively stable, underscoring the \ncrucial importance of reducing total material \nthroughput. Although some targets are in place—\ncaps on greenhouse gas emissions and targets for \nland protection, for example—we need concerted \naction from businesses and others to cut material \nuse. Currently, we are not on track to meet a \nsingle indicator explored in this chapter. This \nchapter’s ‘report card’ shows that we have yet to \nget a passing grade.

      "content": "Understanding material flows: How to \ninterpret the Circularity Indicator Set\nExtraction and consumption are growing at almost \nunprecedented levels, but measuring how and where \nthese material flows are directed can give crucial \ninsight into the circular economy’s transformative \npotential. This chapter opens up the Circularity Gap \nand gives insight into the global material budget \nthrough the Circularity Indicator Set, which measures \nCircular material flows  (Secondary Materials \nand Carbon-Neutral Biomass), Linear material \nflows (Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass, Virgin, Non-\nRenewable Materials, and Fossil Fuels used for \nenergy), and Net stock build-up  (Net Additions to \nStock*). Material flows, whether linear or circular, can \nbe broken down into two ‘cycles’:\n•\n T\nhe technical cycle  relates to the management \nof non-renewable and largely non-biological \nresources that are difficult to reintroduce into \nthe biosphere safely. Examples include concrete, \nplastics and metals, as well as some processed \nbiological materials, such as timber, paper, textiles \nand bioplastics—this is referred to as ‘technical \nbiomass’ throughout this chapter. Materials that \nare part of the technical cycle fall into one of four \ncategories: they become Secondary Materials, \nare Virgin, Non-Renewable Materials destined for \ndisposal without recovery, are added to Stocks, or \nare Fossil Fuels combusted for energy.\n•\n T\nhe ecological cycle  relates to the management \nof renewable, living resources that can cycle in and \nout of the biosphere. It includes biomass used for \nfeed, food or fuel. Materials in the ecological cycle \nare either Carbon-Neutral or Non-Carbon-Neutral \nbiomass. As noted, it’s important to understand \nthat not all biomass stays within the ecological \ncycle, with a portion captured by other indicators.\nFor each indicator, performance is measured on \nboth the input  side—how materials flow into the \neconomy—and the output  side—how these materials \nare processed as waste at their end-of-life. The \nCircularity Metric, for example, is an input-focused \nindicator: it measures the share of secondary \nmaterials flowing into an economy and thus differs \nfrom the global recycling rate, which is an output-\nfocused indicator.\n•\n I\nnput: We start with—and give more relevance \nto—input-side indicators simply because the \nmaterials that enter a system ultimately determine \nwhat comes out. The moment a material leaves the \nenvironment and enters the economy—whether \nextracted from the earth, harvested, or otherwise \nsourced—sets the stage for its entire lifecycle. In a \nmanufacturing facility, for example, the types and \nquantities of raw materials (input) influence the \nquantities of finished products, as well as the waste \nand emissions generated from the production \nprocess. \n•\n O\nutput: Each input-side indicator has a \ncorresponding output. While outputs—like waste, \nemissions and recycled materials—are directly \nlinked to inputs, there’s often a time lag between \nmaterials entering and exiting the system. This is \nbecause materials take different pathways once \nthey enter the economy: some are short-lived —\nlike fuels burnt for energy, fertilisers dissipated \ninto the soil or packaging and consumer goods \nthat are discarded soon after use—and pass \nthrough the system rapidly, becoming outputs \nwithout significant changes in their resource group \ncomposition. Other materials enter the economy \nand become part of Accumulated Stocks —like \nbuildings, infrastructure and vehicles—and remain \nin use for years. Because past and present material \nuse patterns differ in composition, changes \nbetween input- and output-side indicators are \nlargely influenced by the dynamics of stock renewal \nand depletion. Simply put, the materials flowing \nout of the economy today are not shaped just by \nwhat is entering the economy now but largely by \nthe gradual release of materials from Accumulated \nStocks. This highlights the importance of stocks in \ndetermining outputs and, ultimately, the circularity \nof the economy: effective stock management is \ncrucial to maximise circularity and reduce waste \nover time.\n*  The term ‘net’ is important in the context of stock-flow dynamics. \nWe can distinguish three different types of stock accumulation: \nAccumulated Stock, which measures the total volume of materials \nadded to socioeconomic stocks over time; Gross Additions to Stock, \nwhich measures the total amount of materials used in long-lived \napplications (of over one year) in the accounting year . In the context of \nthis analysis, this can include both virgin and secondary materials; and \nNet Additions to Stock, which measures the net amount of materials \nin long-lived applications after accounting for materials removed from \naccumulated stocks through Demolition and Discard in the accounting \nyear . This flow only contains virgin materials, as the amount of \nsecondary materials in both Gross Additions to Stock and Demolition \nand Discard is assumed to be equal within the same accounting year . \nThis report’s analysis measures Net Additions to Stock.\n23\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

We now know \nthe impact of current and unprecedented levels of \nvirgin material use: high greenhouse gas emissions, \nbiodiversity loss and pollution.\n29 In fact, our Circularity \nGap Report 2021 found that as much as 70% of global \nemissions stem from material handling and use.\n30 This \nhighlights the need to reduce virgin material use while \nincreasing secondary material use—both of which \nwill drive up the Circularity Metric . Achieving this \nwill involve cycling all materials that could be cycled \nbut are not (see page 40) and reducing other linear \nactivities, such as fossil fuel use (see page 44). \nIncreasing circularity is far more complex than \njust increasing material cycling.  While increasing \nsecondary material use as much as possible is \nimportant, there’s a natural limit to how much \nthe Circularity Metric can grow. Even if all waste \ncurrently not being recycled was recycled—without \nreducing overall material throughput—we would only \nreach a Circularity Metric of roughly 25%. This puts \nour conception of ‘circularity’ in perspective: true \ncircularity isn’t about recovering and recycling more,  \nit requires fundamentally restructuring how we \nextract, produce and consume materials. The \nCircularity Gap Report 2021 , for example, found that \nrolling out these deep structural changes across \nkey systems—such as housing, food, and mobility—\nwould reduce material use by approximately one-\nthird—shifting us much closer to a sustainable level \nof material use, estimated at 8 tonnes per capita.\n31 \nThis exemplifies the importance of understanding the \nabsolute scale of virgin and secondary material use, \nalongside rates like the Circularity Metric. \nDesired outcome:\nMaximise the use of secondary \nmaterials by: 1) Systematically reducing \nraw material extraction and overall \nmaterial throughput, 2) Ensuring that \nrecycled and by-product materials \nbecome a more mainstream input across \nall economic sectors, and 3) Prioritising \nthe optimisation of material recovery \nfrom Accumulated Stocks such as \nbuildings and infrastructure.\n27\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

There are four criteria for \nbiomass to be considered circular, described in depth \non page 32.\n43 Circular biomass must:\n1. M\ninimise environmental impact:  Assess and \nreduce the impact of biomass extraction on \necosystem services.\n2.\n E\nnsure renewability and regeneration: Use \nbiological materials in a way that respects their \nnatural renewal rates and prioritise regenerative \npractices that lead to improved outcomes \n(afforestation and rewilding, for example).\n3.\n C\nascade use: Reuse bio-based products and \ncascade materials before discarding them.\n4. C\nlose the nutrient cycle: Ensure nutrients return \nsafely to the biosphere at their end-of-life. \nMeasuring the circularity of ‘technical’ materials is \neasier than that of biological materials, as they are \nprocessed and reused within industrial systems. \nWhile biological materials do flow into the industrial \nsystem, their circularity broadly relates to how they’re \nreturned to the natural system and the health of the \nbroader ecosystem that they belong to. This is not \nalways concretely defined nor easily measured.\nBecause determining the circularity of biological \nmaterials is conceptually complex and difficult to \nmeasure,\n44 this indicator captures biomass that meets \nthe minimum criterion of carbon neutrality, meaning it \nabsorbs as much carbon during its growth as it emits \nwhen used. This partially addresses the first and last \ncriteria listed above. While some biomass captured \nby this indicator may meet some or even all of the \nremaining criteria, measuring or guaranteeing this \nis not possible due to data limitations. Biomass that \nmeets none of the criteria is measured by another \nindicator: Non-Carbon-Neutral Biomass.\nAll biomass that stays within the ecological cycle falls \ninto two categories: carbon-neutral and non-carbon-\nneutral. Carbon-Neutral Biomass meets certain \ncriteria to be considered carbon neutral, while Non-\nCarbon-Neutral Biomass exceeds these limits and is \nconsidered ‘in the red’.

This involves improving material \nseparability and biodegradability, minimising \nharmful substances in emissions to the \nenvironment and returning nutrients to \nthe ecosystem in a place and at a rate that \nsupports regeneration. ‘In place’ refers \nto the principle that nutrients should be \nreturned to the place in an ecosystem \nwhere they are needed to sustain biological \nprocesses rather than deposited where \nthey could cause harm—for example, \neutrophication in water bodies. ‘At rate’ \nrefers to the principle that nutrient cycling \nshould align with an ecosystem’s natural \nregenerative capacity, being reintroduced \nat a pace that an ecosystem can absorb, \nprocess and use without being disrupted. \nNote that ‘nutrients’ here refer to nitrogen, \nphosphorus, sulphur, carbon and water.\nDue to methodological constraints and current \ndata availability, it is not possible to assess \nall of these criteria. This is why Ecological \nCycling Potential takes carbon neutrality  as a \nminimum criterion, which partially addresses \nthe first and fourth criteria listed in this box. \nThis approach considers land use, land-use \nchange and forestry emissions to determine \nwhich changes in ecosystem carbon stocks \nresult from biomass extraction. This is a \nminimal requirement but an incomplete one: \nconsider, for example, a sustainably managed \nforest where trees are replanted to replace \nthose harvested. These activities may be \ncarbon neutral, but only considering this aspect \ndoes not account for the loss of the ecological \ncomplexity and biodiversity that are hallmarks \nof old-growth forests.

However, this approach means that it’s difficult \nto monitor and capture circular economy potential \nfully, as the circularity of biomass is not adequately \ncaptured. Biomass is not inherently circular, and the \necological costs of its (over)extraction, from land-use \nchange and the disruption of nutrient cycles to habitat \nand biodiversity loss, can no longer be overlooked. To \nbe fully circular, biomass must:\n1.\n M\ninimise environmental impact:  This means \nassessing and reducing the impact of resource \nextraction on ecosystem services—the benefits \nnature provides to humans, including clean air and \nwater, climate regulation, and natural resources—\nincluding those resulting from land-use change \nand resource depletion. It also involves accounting \nfor the carbon balance by tracking biogenic carbon \nflows—sequestration, storage, and release—and \ntheir impact on the global climate. These flows \ndiffer from fossil carbon in that they cycle through \nthe atmosphere over much shorter timescales.\n2.\n E\nnsure renewability and regeneration:  This \nmeans using biological resources in a way that, at \nthe very least, respects their natural renewal rate, \nprioritising sustainable sourcing to maintain long-\nterm availability. This includes recognising that old, \nwild ecosystems—such as mature forests—provide \nfar greater biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and \necosystem stability compared to new plantations. \nPreserving and sustainably managing natural \necosystems is critical to maintaining these unique \nand irreplaceable benefits.\n3.\n O\nptimise cascading use: This means maximising \nthe value of biological resources 45 by identifying \npathways for their multiple uses and streams, \nensuring resources are reused effectively \nbefore they reach their end-of-life.

This indicator considers biomass \nthat is carbon neutral as a minimum criterion for \nmeasuring its circularity.

Because of this, a more \ncircular and sustainable world would not necessarily \nresult in an increase in the rate or scale of Carbon-\nNeutral Biomass extraction. Regardless of whether \nthis indicator grows or shrinks, it’s crucial that all \nmaterials captured by it undergo full nutrient cycling: \nas discussed, this important criterion is not aptly \nreflected.

A disproportionate fraction of global land \nis used intensively, primarily for agricultural purposes \nsuch as pasture and animal feed production:\n48 half \nthe world’s habitable land is used for agriculture, \nwith 80% of this dedicated to livestock. Despite \nthe space required to rear livestock and grow feed \ncrops, livestock provides only a fraction of the global \ncalorie supply.\n49 On a planet with limited space, \nthis inefficiency has significant consequences. \nAs agricultural land continues to expand—often \nencroaching on forests, wetlands and other wild \necosystems—we continue to witness a severe retreat \nof nature.

To rebalance global land use, we need \nto redesign the food system into a holistic, circular \nand regenerative system that safeguards planetary \nand human health.\n52 Leveraging a sustainable global \nfood system’s full potential requires transforming \nboth production and consumption patterns. This \nincludes minimising synthetic fertilisers that pollute \nsoil and water, prioritising regenerative practices \nlike agroforestry and integrated livestock systems, \nand promoting nourishing diets with more plant-\nbased foods and fewer ultra-processed products.\n53,54  \nThese practices can decrease demand for land and \nother resources, such as water, freeing up space for \nrewilding and reforestation, helping restore damaged \necosystems, expanding global carbon sinks, and \nallowing biodiversity to flourish. It will also build up \nthe resilience of food production and improve food \nsecurity in many countries and regions.\nBuilding a sustainable, circular bioeconomy is \nessential for advancing sustainable resource \nuse, but there is no harmonised methodology \nto measure and monitor it. Measuring the rate of \nCarbon-Neutral Biomass is also important to monitor \nthe sustainability and circularity of the bioeconomy, \nwhich covers all sectors and activities that rely on \nbiological resources (animals, plants, microorganisms \nand derived biomass, including organic waste) and \ntheir ecological functions.\n55 A ‘circular bioeconomy’ \nis an economic model that combines the principles \nof both the circular economy and the bioeconomy \nand aims to optimise the use of renewable biological \nresources while minimising waste and environmental \nimpact through circular practices. \nTo understand and measure progress towards a more \ncircular bioeconomy, it is therefore important to break \ndown the factors influencing these indicators through \na number of sub-indicators. These indicators’ status—\nand whether or not they have relevant global or sub-\nglobal targets—is summarised in Table four.\nInput:  Global biomass extraction  is a key driver of \nenvironmental impacts: its scale is crucial to track. \nIn 2021, this indicator stood at 26.3 billion tonnes, \nequivalent to 3.3 tonnes per capita.\n56 Various biomass \nmaterials and farming practices have different \nassociated impacts: livestock systems, for example, \nhave much higher material, carbon and land footprints \nthan crops cultivated for direct human use.\n57 This \nis why measuring extraction indicators by biomass \ntype and activity  can help indicate where the most \nimpact can be made. Water stress —which measures \nthe share of total human water withdrawals relative to \navailable freshwater resources—provides important \ninsight into the sustainability of biomass production, \nespecially in water-scarce regions.\n58 Globally, water \nstress is 18.6%, but levels vary substantially by region. \nCentral and Southern Asia have high water stress \nlevels—surpassing 75%—while Northern Africa’s water \nstress exceeds 100%, requiring groundwater depletion \nor desalination, for example.

Harvesting biomass at a rate \nthat exceeds its natural capacity for regeneration \nessentially makes it a finite, rather than renewable, \nresource.\n78 If biomass is harvested faster than it can \nregrow or reabsorb the same amount of carbon, it is \nno longer carbon neutral because the total carbon \nstock declines. The same applies to soil, another \nrapidly degrading key renewable resource strongly \nlinked to biomass extraction.\n79 For this reason, \nunderstanding the climate impact of biomass use \nmeans understanding the time-explicit nature of \ncarbon flows: the rate at which carbon is sequestered, \nhow long it’s stored, and how quickly it’s released \nback into the atmosphere.\n80, 81, 82   Non-Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass is that which results in emissions from land \nuse and land-cover change through activities that \ndrive deforestation—particularly in tropical forests\n83 \n—and forest degradation and land conversion for \nagriculture, for example. This could include forest \nbiomass harvesting for large-scale bioenergy \nproduction and practices like shifting cultivation, \nwhere plots of land are temporarily converted for \nagriculture and then abandoned and are unable to be \nfully restored. The drainage and excavation of peat \nfor agricultural purposes also contribute to emissions. \nAlthough peatlands represent just 3% of the world’s \nland area,\n84 they store vast amounts of carbon, and \ndisrupting them releases large volumes of methane, \nthe most potent greenhouse gas.\n85\nDesired outcome:\nEliminate the use of biomass that: \n1) Surpasses the natural rate of \nregeneration or leads to net positive \ncarbon emissions due to land use change, \n2) Disrupts ecological timescales and \nexisting carbon and nutrient balances.\n38\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

Going forward, it will \nbe crucial to balance the provision of essential services \nwith optimised material use and the integration of \ncircular principles. \nDesired outcome:\nOptimise material accumulation in \nstocks by: 1) Maximising the use and \nadaptation of existing physical assets, \nsuch as buildings, infrastructure, \nand machinery, instead of building/\nproducing new, 2) Increasing the share \nof sustainably-managed renewable \nmaterials in stock composition, and 3) \nPrioritising circular design principles—\nsuch as design for durability, repairability, \ndisassembly and recyclability—in new \nstock additions.\n50\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

Upper-middle and especially high-\nincome countries have historically built up their \nstock,\n134 while lower-income countries are still \ndeveloping stock to meet their residents’ societal \nneeds. Total floor space is expected to grow by 97 \nbillion square metres between 2022 and 2030, with \nthe bulk of this notable increase likely to be driven \nby lower- and middle-income countries.\n135 This \nunderscores the need for sustainable practices in \nconstruction and resource management to mitigate \nthe environmental impacts associated with this \ngrowth: Lower-income countries should develop stock \nin line with circular principles that maximise resource \nefficiency—such as prioritising secondary and low-\ncarbon materials and designing for durability, reuse \nand disassembly at end-of-life—and sustainably \noptimise and manage stock expansion.\n136 At the \nsame time, the current weight of per capita stocks is \nhigher in industrialised countries than in developing \ncountries:\n137 residents of high-income nations \nconsume significantly more materials than those in \nlow-income nations, regardless of urbanisation levels. \nFor this reason, higher-income, stock-rich countries \nshould aim to minimise new stock growth, prioritise \nrenovation and adaptation over building new, \nmaximise the intensity of building use, and maximise \nmaterial efficiency for long-lasting manufactured \ngoods, for example. Durable, repairable, and modular \ndesign approaches can significantly extend the \nusability of these assets. \nEmbedding circular economy principles into urban \nplanning and development will be key to reducing \nglobal resource use and achieving a more circular \neconomy. As urban areas grow, so too does stock \nbuild-up, thus locking in materials for decades, \nshaping material demand patterns and slowing the \nrate at which these resources can re-enter the system \nthrough reuse or recycling. Without strategies to \noptimise urban planning and stock build-up—such as \nlocalised operations, material-efficient construction, \nadaptive reuse, and designing for longevity—cities \nrisk becoming long-term hotspots of growing material \ndemand, exacerbating resource depletion and \nenvironmental pressures. By 2050, urban material \nconsumption is projected to grow by 150%, from 40 \nbillion tonnes in 2010 to 90 billion tonnes.\n129 However, \ndesigning compact, resource-efficient cities based on \ncircular economy principles could cut greenhouse gas \nemissions by 36–56% while also lowering demand for \nmetals, land, energy and water.\n130 At the same time, \nactively ‘mining’ materials from Accumulated Stocks—\ninstead of the natural environment—provides another \nkey opportunity to boost circularity by increasing the \npool of secondary materials available.\nThe sheer scale of non-metallic mineral use—driven \nby stock build-up—has fuelled the unprecedented \naccumulation of human-made materials. While all \nmaterial groups are linked to stock build-up, non-\nmetallic minerals make up the largest portion. This \nis in part due to their substantial weight: the sand \nand limestone used to produce cement and gravel \nused to build roads and fill construction sites, for \nexample. Non-metallic mineral extraction has grown \nexponentially in past decades, from 8.5 billion tonnes \nin 1970 to 47.9 billion tonnes in 2021 (see Figure one). \nThis is a key reason why, in 2020, humanity reached a \nnew milestone when the mass of human-made things \nsurpassed that of all living things on Earth—plants, \nanimals and humans.\n131 The weight of Accumulated \nStocks on Earth has also significantly increased over \nthe past decades, estimated at over 1 trillion tonnes \nin 2016. The majority of these materials are found in \nroads (313 billion tonnes), residential buildings (290 \nbillion tonnes), civil engineering (243 billion tonnes) \nand non-residential buildings (234 billion tonnes). \nMachinery and other shorter-lived products contribute \nfar less, with the weight of motor vehicles totalling just \n51\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

This \nwill provide clarity to both internal and external \nstakeholders about their commitment to reducing \nmaterial use, promoting the reuse of products, \nand enhancing transparency—whilst remaining \ncompetitive. Through clearly defined resource \ntargets tied to business strategy and operations, \nbusinesses can demonstrate tangible progress on \ntheir circular economy journey while aligning their \noperations with sustainability goals.\nInvest in the circular economy now to ensure \nthat they remain competitive and future-proof. \nTransitioning to circular models provides new \nmarket opportunities. By investing in renewable \nresources, sustainable production technologies, \nreverse logistics infrastructure, and circular product \ndesign, businesses can secure long-term success, \nenhance their competitive edge, and reduce risks \nrelated to geopolitical matters, resource scarcity \nand regulatory changes. Rethinking product \nportfolios to align with circular principles—such \nas designing for durability, repairability, and \nrecyclability—will be key to adapting to evolving \nmarket demands. The global economy is now \nfacing increasing supply chain disruptions, \nparticularly for the critical raw materials essential \nto decarbonisation and digitalisation, as well as \na number of key manufacturing industries. With \nescalating demand, businesses that integrate \ncircular strategies and localise their operations \ncan shorten supply chains and ultimately reduce \ndependence on global markets. Circular business \nmodels can drive value through cost reduction, \nresource efficiency, and innovation, and the metrics \nused to track these activities—such as circular \ninflow (the use of recycled materials), circular \noutflow (end-of-life management), and waste/\nresource consumption avoided—will be essential to \nevaluate and scale their impact.\nCollaborate and work together within value \nchains to optimise resource use and drive \ninnovation. Businesses should collaborate across \nthe full value chain to optimise material use and \novercome economic split incentives. By joining \nforces with suppliers, manufacturers, and other \npartners, companies can drive innovation and \ninvest in the changes needed to make circular \nsolutions viable. Collaboration helps to build \neconomies of scale, reduce costs, and share \nknowledge, ultimately accelerating the adoption \nof circular practices across entire industries. In \ndoing so, businesses can also address the risks \ninherent in the current linear economy, such as \nsupply chain disruptions, resource scarcity, and \nincreasing regulatory burdens. By working together \nto shift to circular solutions, companies can unlock \nopportunities to create new markets, optimise \nmaterials use, and ensure long-term resilience.\nWhat businesses \ncan do\n63\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

[ Source]\nConsumption  refers to the usage or consumption \nof products and services meeting demand. Absolute \nconsumption  refers to the total volume of either \nphysical or monetary consumption of an economy, \ndomestic or global, as a whole. In this report, when \nwe talk about consumption , we are referring to \nabsolute consumption.\nCycling  refers to the process of converting a material \ninto a material or product of a higher (upcycling), \nsame (recycling) or lower (downcycling) embodied \nvalue and/or complexity than it originally was.\nDecoupling  refers to a trend that occurs when \nthe growth rate of an environmental impact (for \nexample, CO\n2 emissions) is less than that of its \neconomic driving force (for example, gross domestic \nproduct) over a given period. Decoupling can be \neither absolute or relative. Absolute decoupling  is \ndefined as when the environmental impact is stable \nor decreases when the economic driving force is \ngrowing. Relative decoupling  is defined as when the \ngrowth rate of the environmental impact is positive \nbut less than the growth rate of the economic driving \nforce. [ Source]\nDomestic Material Consumption  is an \nenvironmental indicator that covers the flows of \nboth products and raw materials by accounting for \ntheir mass. It can take an ‘apparent consumption’ \nperspective—the mathematical sum of domestic \nproduction and imports minus exports—without \nconsidering changes in stocks. It can also take a \n‘direct consumption’ perspective, in that products for \nimport and export do not account for the inputs—be \nthey raw materials or other products—used in their \nproduction. [Own elaboration based on Source ]\nEconomy-wide material flow  accounts is a \n‘statistical accounting framework describing the \nphysical interaction of the economy with the natural \nenvironment and with the rest of the world economy \nin terms of flows of materials.’ [ Source]\nGreenhouse gases (GHG)  refers to a group of \ngases contributing to global warming and climate \nbreakdown. The term covers seven greenhouse \ngases divided into two categories. Converting them \nto carbon dioxide equivalent  (CO\n2e) through the \napplication of characterisation factors makes it \npossible to compare them and to determine their \nindividual and total contributions to Global Warming \nPotential (see below). [ Source]\nGross Additions to Stock  measures the total  \namount of materials used in long-lived applications  \n(of over one year) in the accounting year. In the \ncontext of this analysis, this can include both virgin \nand secondary materials.\nHigh-value recycling  refers to the extent to \nwhich, through the recycling chain, the distinct \ncharacteristics of a material (the polymer, the glass \nor the paper fibre, for example) are preserved or \nrecovered so as to maximise their potential to be re-\nused in a circular economy. [ Source]\nMaterials , as referred to in this report, are non-\nmetallic minerals, metal ores, biomass, and fossil \nfuels, used as inputs to production or manufacturing \nbecause of their properties. Materials are a type \nof natural resource, alongside land and water, for \nexample.\nMaterial extraction  is an environmental indicator \nthat measures, in physical weight, the amount of raw \nmaterials extracted from the natural environment for \nuse in any economy. It excludes water and air. At the \nnational level, this indicator is called Domestic Material \nExtraction. [ Source]\nMaterial footprint , also referred to as Raw Material \nConsumption, is the attribution of global material \nextraction to the domestic final demand of a  \ncountry—referred to as a consumption-based \napproach . The material footprint equals the total \nvolume of virgin materials embodied within the  \nsupply chain to meet final demand. At the global  \nlevel, Raw Material Consumption is equivalent to \nmaterial extraction (see above). [ Source] \nAppendix A: Glossary\n64\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

      "content": "Material flows represent the amounts of \nmaterials in physical weight that are available to \nan economy. These material flows comprise the \nextraction of materials within the economy as \nwell as the physical imports and exports (such as \nthe mass of goods imported or exported). Air and \nwater are generally excluded. [ Source]\nNet Additions to Stock  measures the net \namount of materials long-lived applications after \naccounting for materials removed from existing \nAccumulated Stocks through Demolition and \nDiscard. This flow only contains virgin materials, \nas the amount of secondary materials in both \nGross Additions to Stock and Demolition and \nDiscard is assumed to be equal within the same \naccounting year.\nPlanetary boundaries  define the ‘safe operating \nspace’ for humanity based on the planet’s key \nbiophysical processes. Originally developed by \nRockström et al. (2009), the framework quantifies \nnine ‘limits’ for ensuring a stable and resilient \nEarth system. Six of nine boundaries have now \nbeen transgressed. [ Source]\nResources  include, for example, arable land, \nfreshwater, and materials. They are seen as \nparts of the natural world that can be used for \neconomic activities that produce goods and \nservices. Material resources are biomass (like \ncrops for food, energy and bio-based materials, as \nwell as wood for energy and industrial uses), fossil \nfuels (in particular coal, gas and oil for energy), \nmetals (such as iron, aluminium and copper used \nin construction and electronics manufacturing) \nand non-metallic minerals (used for construction, \nnotably sand, gravel and limestone). [ Source]\nResource efficiency means creating more \n(economic) value with less input of resources (for \nexample, raw materials, energy, water, air, land, \nsoil, and ecosystem services) and reducing the \nenvironmental impacts associated with resource \nuse to break the link between economic growth \nand the use of nature. Therefore, resource \nefficiency is closely linked to the concept of \n(relative/absolute) decoupling. [ Source]\nSecondary materials  are materials that \nhave been used once and are recovered and \nreprocessed for subsequent use. This refers to the \namount of the outflow that can be recovered to \nbe re-used or refined to re-enter the production \nstream. One aim of dematerialisation is to \nincrease the amount of secondary materials used \nin production and consumption to create a more \ncircular economy. [ Source]\nSufficiency , as defined by the IPCC, is a set of \npolicy measures and daily practices that avoid \ndemand for energy, materials, land, water, and \nother natural resources while delivering human \nwellbeing for all within planetary boundaries. \n[Source]\nTotal material consumption  is calculated by \nadding Raw Material Consumption (material \nfootprint) and secondary material consumption \n(cycled materials). \n65\nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025",

      "content": "1. INTRODUCTION \nThe Circularity Gap Report 2025 provides a comprehensive progress report on the state of the \nglobal circular economy. With the understanding that the circular economy transition is about \nmore than just recycling, the report opens up the ‘Circularity Gap’, providing a wealth of headline \nand sub-indicators to support the Circularity Metric—measured by Circle Economy since 2018. It \npresents and builds on the Circularity Indicator Set, a dashboard of 11 indicators, incorporating \nbeneﬁcial aspects of other leading frameworks: ISO/DIS 59020:2023(E): Circular \nEconomy—Measuring and Assessing Circularity and the Conference of European Statisticians \nGuidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: Conceptual Framework, Indicators and \nMeasurement Framework. This complementary white paper gives deeper insight into the \nCircularity Indicator Set, explores the structure and scope of the two additional frameworks, and \nlays out how we’ve incorporated these in our work. \n2. UNPACKING THE CIRCULARITY INDICATOR \nSET \nThe Circularity Indicator Set is a system of tiered indicators designed to measure how circular an \neconomy is. This indicator set and its underlying measurement framework, which are explored in \nmore depth in the methodology document of the Circularity Gap Report 2025, has been \nhistorically used by and built upon by Circle Economy to provide insight into all inputs and \noutputs of an economy. Our ‘Circularity Metric’—or Input Technical Cycling rate—is perhaps the \nmost well-known of these indicators. Collectively, the Indicator Set examines the relationships \nbetween resources we take from nature, how we use them, and their impact on the \nenvironment. In alignment with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts Central \nFramework (SEEA-CF), this framework is centred on the idea of a socioeconomic system that \nrests ‘inside’ the environment, with materials \nﬂowing between and within the two. Although this \nanalysis has a global scope, the measurement framework can be set up at the (multi- and \nsub-)national level to account for trade and the movement of materials between nations, which \nis important when assessing environmental footprints. Circle Economy supports national and \nregional economies in using the Circularity Indicator Set for analysis, but is also using it for \ntargeted assessments, such as for industries: the Circularity Gap Report Textiles, launched in 2024, \nfor example. The Indicator Set can also be adapted for analysis at the product level.  This \nﬂexibility comes from its tiered structure, which allows for detailed or broader analysis \ndepending on the context. The Indicator Set relies—as much as possible—on highly-harmonised \nand regularly updated data, ensuring accurate comparisons between countries and enabling the \nconsistent monitoring of progress toward a circular economy. This framework lends itself well to \nintegration with other leading indicator frameworks for the circular economy, discussed in the \nfollowing section.  \nThe Circularity Indicator Set is grounded in the SEEA-CF, and its subsystem of Economy-Wide \nMaterial Flow Accounts (EW-MFA), and builds upon leading academic work in the ﬁeld of \n ",

This \ncomprehensive measure is enabled by core features of the Set, discussed in more detail below:  \n● The distinction between rate and scale indicators to measure circularity at both the \ninput and output side; \n● The distinction between technical and ecological cycles; \n● The distinction between natural and anthropogenic ﬂows; \n● The distinction between material ﬂows and stocks. \nRate and scale indicators. Rate indicators, expressed as percentages of a total, measure the \n‘circular performance’ of an economy. An Input Technical Cycling rate (Circularity Metric) of 0% \nrepresents a fully linear economy, while a rate of 100% represents a (thermodynamically \nunfeasible) perfect circular economy, where all processed materials are cycled without losses. \nEach indicator in the Set is also ascribed a ‘scale’ \nﬁgure, which expresses the material use as an \nabsolute value. Rate and scale indicators are measured at both the input and output side (see \nTable one). \nTechnical and ecological cycling rates. The technical cycle refers to the processes that \nproducts and materials ﬂow through in order to maintain their highest possible value at all \ntimes. It involves ﬁnite materials (alongside small amounts of biomass that enter the technical \ncycle) that are not consumed during use and industrial processes such as reuse, refurbishment, \nremanufacturing and recycling. In the Circularity Gap Report approach speciﬁcally, it includes \nrecyclable end-of-life waste handled by waste management (on the output side) and \nreintroduced into the market as secondary materials (on the input side) - as well as reused \nproducts and by-products that are cycled without becoming waste. It does not include \nﬂows \nrelated to other processes that extend product lifetimes such as repair, sharing, refurbishment \nor remanufacturing. The ecological cycle refers to the processes—such as composting and \nanaerobic digestion—that collectively help regenerate natural capital. It involves renewable \nmaterials that can decompose and reintegrate into natural cycles, preferably regenerating and at \nthe very least without harming ecosystems. In the Circularity Gap Report approach speciﬁcally, it \nrefers to the ﬂow of carbon-neutral biomass and the resulting outﬂows to the environment, \nwhich re-enter global biogeochemical cycles and are separate from the technical system. Both \nrates—referring to technical and ecological cycling—are based on the same system deﬁnitions \nand measured against the same reference ﬂow: processed materials, whether for input or \ninterim output.. This shared denominator ensures that the rates are consistent, mutually \n4 Haas, W., Virág, D., Wiedenhofer, D., & von Blottnitz, H. (2023). How circular is an extractive economy?

Natural ﬂows are resources (such as extracted raw \nmaterials on the input side) or residuals (discharged waste and emissions on the output side) \nthat originate from or are destined to return to the environment. Notably, natural ﬂows can \ninclude both ecological, potentially-renewable materials, as well as inert non-renewable ones, \nsuch as metals, non-metallic minerals and fossil fuels. Anthropogenic \nﬂows, by contrast, \noriginate from or are destined to return to socioeconomic systems.

This distinction is particularly relevant in \nthe context of trade and the calculation of Raw Material Equivalents5 in material footprinting. \nFlows and stocks. Activities in the socioeconomic system6 are fed by ﬂows of materials: these \ncome from the natural environment, are processed by industries, and are then either \naccumulated in physical stocks or transformed and released back into the environment as waste \nor emissions. Materials added to stocks—like buildings, infrastructure, and durable goods like \nmachinery, equipment and vehicles—are represented by the indicator Net Additions to Stock. \nThis indicator measures the physical growth of an economy, and exposes the time lag between \nmaterial consumption and waste generation. Although circular activities like repair, \nremanufacturing and sharing are not explicitly captured by the Circularity Indicator Set, their \nimpact is implicitly captured by Net Additions to Stock: we would expect to see an increase in the \nservice lifetimes of in-use stocks and potentially a stabilisation in the growth of in-use stocks.  \nTable one provides values for each headline indicator on the input and output side for 2021, the year of \nlatest available data.7 \n \nIndicator \nInput Output \nRate (%) Scale \n(billion \ntonnes) \nRate (%) Scale (billion \ntonnes) \nCircular \nmaterial \nﬂ\nows \nTechnical Cycling \nrate 6.9% 7.3 11.2% 7.3 \nEcological Cycling \nPotential rate 21.5% 22.8 35.5% 23.2 \nLinear \nmaterial \nﬂ\nows \nNon-Renewable \nBiomass rate 2.2% 2.3 3.4% 2.2 \nNon-Renewable \nFlows rate 18.1% 19.2 28.6% 18.8 \n7 Circle Economy analysis. \n6 Socioeconomic systems are large systems with people at the core, including social, economic, scientiﬁc, technological, \nand ecological environment ﬁelds, involving various aspects of human activities and the many complex factors of the \nliving environment. \n5 Raw Material Equivalents refers to all the materials used to manufacture each component of a product.

While the ISO/DIS 59020 standard is largely \noperational—meaning it’s centred on boundary setting, data acquisition, quality assurance, and \ndocumentation and reporting—it also establishes a measurement framework along with 14 core \ncircularity indicators (learn more about types of frameworks in the text box on page 10).  \nThese indicators take a multilevel perspective, pertaining to systems (regions, organisations, and \nproducts), structures (subsystems, sub-regions, and functional units, for example) and circular \nactivities (such as reuse, repair, and so on). Indicators are also structured along four categories: \nenergy, water, economic value, and in\nﬂows and outﬂows of resources. Resource indicators \ncategorise inﬂows and outﬂows into four mutually exclusive types—recycled, reused, virgin \nrenewable, and virgin non-renewable—which prevents overlap and adds up to 100%. The \nframework also factors in stocks—which remain in use over time—though this is done as a \nseparate indicator, assessing product lifetimes in comparison to industry averages rather than \nfully integrating stock levels into material ﬂow calculations. \nThe ISO/DIS measurement framework and indicator set are both relatively simple. The \nmeasurement framework deﬁnes the system being analysed in terms of its level, structure, and \nactions. The system in focus is embedded into environmental and social systems, with a few \ngeneral ﬂows describing how they interact with each other: ‘primary resource inﬂows’ represents \nthe sourcing of materials from the environment, for example, while ‘non-circular resource \noutputs’ represents the outﬂow of materials to the environment. Inﬂows and outﬂows can also \nbe considered ‘circular’ depending on the system boundary they cross: they can be internal, \nstaying within the system in focus (reprocessing of scrap, for example), re-entering from the \nsocioeconomic system (through recycling, for example), or re-entering from the environmental \nsystem (through composting, for example). In this framework, trade ﬂows and interactions with \nother ‘systems’—such as other national economies—are not speciﬁed.  \nISO/DIS 59004 Circular Economy—Terminology, Principles and Guidance for Implementation, \nseparate from the measurement framework, lays out terms and deﬁnitions, transitioning \nprinciples, and general practical aspects of shifting to a circular economy. While this is useful for \norganisations to understand and contribute to circularity, it does not systematically or \nstructurally organise the indicators proposed in the standard. In the ISO/DIS 59020 standard,  \nﬁve categories of core indicators—resource inﬂows, resource outﬂows, energy, water, and \nvalue—are not directly addressed by the document. It instead largely centres on general \nprinciples organisations should align with—system thinking and value creation, for \nexample—and actions they should carry out, such as design for circularity, repair, and recycling. \nWhat’s more, although the standard acknowledges the interconnectedness of economic, social, \nand environmental systems and suggests complementary methods for impact assessment, it \nlacks a structured, interlinked framework for measuring circularity. Critical aspects like \nenvironmental impact, employment eﬀects, supply security, and policy considerations are \nmentioned but not integrated into a cohesive measurement approach. As a result, the ISO 59000 \nseries serves as a conceptual foundation but falls short of oﬀering a comprehensive indicator \nframework for the circular economy. \n ",

Its \nheadline deﬁnition captures the core principles shared across circular economy models: \nmaximising the value of materials for as long as possible, minimising material input and \nconsumption, preventing waste, and reducing negative environmental impacts throughout a \nmaterial’s life cycle. Contrary to the ISO standard, the UNECE/OECD guidelines also oﬀer a \nconceptual framework (see text box on page 10), and combines the main features of a circular \neconomy—such as the four ﬂows*8 9—with the basic principles of environmental accounting and \nreporting.10 11 12 All dimensions of the circular economy—including physical, environmental, and \nsystemic aspects across the entire lifecycle of materials, products, and services—are covered. \nCore indicators are structured according to four main so-called ‘building blocks’: the material \nlife cycle and value chain, interactions with the environment, socioeconomic \nopportunities, and responses and actions (including innovation, regulatory and other \ninstruments, and education, for example).  \nEach building block has a subset of themes and topics that provide an increasing level of detail, \nwith each theme and topic having its own set of complementary and contextual indicators.13 The \nfull set comprises 16 core indicators (plus 5 placeholders for situations where no suitable \nindicator can be identiﬁed), more than 70 complementary indicators, and 13 contextual \nindicators.14 While these all ﬁt within one overarching conceptual and measurement framework, \nthey still act as stand-alone indicators for a broad range of interlinked topics; however, while this \nset comprehensively covers all aspects relevant to the circular economy, it lacks a common \ndenominator, meaning that indicators may use diﬀerent units, methods or scales. This \nfundamental diﬀerence between indicators means that they lack a common basis for \ncomparison or aggregation, making it diﬃcult to integrate into a cohesive whole.  \n14 Core and complementary indicators are related to each other: for instance, the ‘National recycling rate’ indicator is \nrelated to the ‘Waste going to ﬁnal disposal’, ‘Circular material use rate’, and ‘Ratio of products repaired or reused to new \nproducts sold’ indicators. However, the link between them is underspeciﬁed, posing a number of questions: are they \ncalculated using the same or similar metrics? Where and how do they diﬀer? Do they overlap? \n13 For example, the ‘material life cycle and value chain’ building block is divided into three themes: the ﬁrst of these ‘The \nmaterial basis of the economy—production, consumption, accumulation” is further divided into three topics, ‘Material \ninputs’, ‘Material consumption’ and ‘Accumulation’.

Notably—and in contrast to the ISO/DIS standard—the \nguidelines explicitly cover the interactions between the system in focus (a national economy, for \nexample) with other economies and their environments.

It is ﬁrst translated into simple measurement concepts comparable to those given by \nthe ISO/DIS 59020 framework. Next, the framework is expanded to focus on interactions \nbetween the production and consumption system with the waste management system and \nother more informal waste management activities.  \nUnderstanding diﬀerent types of frameworks \nWhat to measure: A conceptual framework, such as that oﬀered by the UNECE/OECD \nguidelines, helps structure the selection of indicators to ensure all important aspects of the \ncircular economy are covered. It reﬂects the integrated, cross-cutting nature of the circular \neconomy and organises indicators in a way that’s practical and accessible for decision-makers \nand the public. \nHow to measure it, from a data perspective: A measurement and monitoring framework, \noﬀered by both the ISO standard and UNECE/OECD guidelines, helps to structure and \ncombine underlying data, link circular economy concepts and deﬁnitions to the terms and \ndeﬁnitions used in oﬃcial statistics, and ensure that data sets are coherent. These beneﬁt \npolicymakers by providing reliable, comparable and comprehensive data and indicators to \nsupport informed decision-making. \nHow to measure it, from a process perspective: An operational framework, such as that \noﬀered by the ISO standard, tells us how to measure circularity by providing rules, procedures \nand guidelines on the processes underlying the development and use of indicators.

This ﬁrst comprehensive and cohesive look at measuring the circular economy is \nexplored in more depth in Chapter three of the Circularity Gap Report 2025, which presents the \nCircularity Indicator Set supported by relevant sub-indicators for changemakers drawn from the \nUNECE/OECD frameworks. Our focus is on converging the ‘material life cycle and value chain’ \ntheme from the UNECE/OECD framework with the ‘resource inputs’ and ‘resource outputs’ \ncategories from the ISO/DIS 59020 framework, providing a common language for two \nframeworks that measure similar metrics but otherwise use varying scales and terminology. In \ndoing so, we beneﬁt from applying the ‘mutually exclusive’ logic of the resource inputs and \noutputs categories to the statistical domain of environmental accounts (for example, material \nﬂow, emissions, waste, and water accounts), from which many UNECE ‘material life cycle and \nvalue chain’ indicators are derived. This allows us to consistently measure themes relevant to the \ncircular economy—from the bioeconomy and energy transition to socioeconomic stocks—from \nboth a material inﬂow and outﬂow perspective. \nBarriers to fully integrating the ISO/DIS standard and the UNECE/OECD framework \nThe main barrier to fully integrating these work streams lies in a few fundamental diﬀerences \nin goals, scope and deﬁnitions. These are broadly summarised below: \n● Focus and application: The ISO/DIS 59020 standard is product- and process-oriented, \nproviding a technically precise framework for organisations conducting speciﬁc \ncircularity assessments. In contrast, the UNECE/OECD guidelines take a broader, more \nﬂexible approach, focusing on systemic issues and enabling circular economy \nmonitoring at regional and national levels. \n● Treatment of water and energy: The UNECE/OECD framework accounts for water \nand energy only in terms of their interactions with the environment: water pollution or \nenergy-related emissions, for example. However, it does not account for water or \nenergy consumption per se. The ISO/DIS standard does the opposite: it accounts for \nwater used in the processes under analysis and energy consumption in energy terms \n(i.e. kilowatt hours of electricity rather than tonnes of coal burnt), but does not \nexplicitly cover their environmental impacts. Nonetheless, the sustainable use of \nfreshwater and energy remains conceptually relevant to circular economy discussions. \n● Terminology and measurement: The ISO/DIS standard broadly deﬁnes ‘resources’ as \nincluding raw materials, feedstocks, and components. The UNECE/OECD framework, \nhowever, uses more precise statistical classiﬁcations, distinguishing between natural \nresources, primary and secondary raw materials, and residuals.

The Circularity \nIndicator Set takes the same approach as the ISO standard, dividing resources into mutually \nexclusive categories: recycled and reused, virgin renewable, and virgin non-renewable materials. \nWhile the ISO standard was designed to apply this logic primarily at the product or organisational \nlevel, the Circularity Indicator Set scales it up for application at the national level, creating \nheadline indicators in both the input (materials entering the economy) and output (waste and \nemissions) side of the system under study. In order to better comply with the ISO standard, we \nhave introduced a number of other methodological modi\nﬁcations to the Circularity Indicator Set: \nthese are explored in detail in the text box below. \nModiﬁcations to the Circularity Indicator Set made by Circle Economy \n1. Diﬀerentiating between ‘Recycled/Reused’ and ‘Recyclable/Reusable’ materials: The \nISO/DIS 59020 standard requires that recycling and reuse are measured on both the input and \noutput side: \nInput: Measures the fraction of resources conﬁrmed as recycled content, including pre- and \npost-consumer materials but excluding internal industrial reuse. Reuse is strictly deﬁned as \nremanufacturing, excluding broader durability-related aspects like repair or refurbishment. \n● Output: Estimates the fraction of outﬂow content that was (or is likely to be) recovered \nand recycled into secondary materials or reused in production, maintenance, or repair. \nFrom an economy-wide perspective, this distinction allows us to diﬀerentiate between waste \ncollected for recycling and actual secondary materials.15 Waste collected for recycling is \nmeasured at the recycling plant gate, whereas secondary materials are tracked at their market \ndeployment point. The diﬀerence reﬂects sorting and processing losses, meaning Eurostat’s \nassumption that ‘input to recovery plants is an acceptable proxy for output’16 is no longer valid. \nThese losses must now be explicitly quantiﬁed.

Deﬁning and quantifying ‘Sustainably Produced Renewable Content’ and \n‘Recirculation—Safe Return to the Biosphere’: The ISO/DIS 59020 standard deﬁnes \nrenewable material as ‘biomass that is replenishable at a rate equal to or greater than the rate \nof depletion,’ with bio-based inﬂows considered circular only if they are sustainably managed. \nOn the output side, the ‘percent actual recirculation of outﬂow in the biological cycle’ indicator \nmeasures the fraction of biomass or nutrients safely returned to the biosphere (for example, \nvia composting or anaerobic digestion). These deﬁnitions align with the Ecological Cycling \nPotential indicator. While methodologies for systematically assessing the sustainability of \nbiomass are still evolving, the economy-wide biogenic carbon balance approach by Haas et al. \n(2020)17 serves as an initial proxy for estimating renewable biomass inputs and safe biological \nrecirculation. \n3. Aligning with a lifetime perspective on long-term products and materials: Measuring \nthe relationship between physical stock, durability, and value retention is complex in a circular \neconomy.

As noted previously, circular economy strategies such as product lifetime extension, \nrenovation, and sharing can be indirectly observed through the potential stabilisation of in-use \nstock growth, as indicated by the Net Additions to Stock indicator. In contrast, the ISO/DIS \n59020 standard measures a product or material’s expected useful lifetime based on durability \nassessments that consider reliability and lifetime extensions through maintenance, repair, and \nrefurbishment. This reﬂects a key diﬀerence: \n● Circularity Indicator Set: Categorises material inﬂows and outﬂows by their destination \n(for example, stocked, technically cycled, or non cycled). \n● ISO/DIS 59020: Classiﬁes materials based on content (for example, virgin \nnon-renewable, recycled), with ‘stocked’ not considered a separate ﬂow type. \nTo comply with ISO/DIS 59020, the Circularity Indicator Set now includes a new \nindicator—‘average lifetime of stock relative to the global average’—alongside the traditional \nnet stocking rate. This sub-indicator oﬀers a more detailed view of material accumulation, \naligning with UNECE/OECD core indicators. \nSome of the Set’s indicators align directly with certain topics of the UNECE/OECD framework: for \nexample, the Input Technical Cycling rate and Output Technical Cycling rate directly measure the \ntopics ‘Circularity of material ﬂows’ and ‘Materials diverted from ﬁnal disposal through recycling \nor recovery’, respectively. Others, however, do so less directly. The Input Non-Renewable rate \nand Output Non-Renewable Rate, for example, account for the amount of potentially recyclable \nmaterials that are instead disposed of and can be used to measure the topic ‘Materials leaving \n17 Haas, W., Krausmann, F., Wiedenhofer, D., Lauk, C., & Mayer, A.

However, they are not suited to capturing the topic ‘Waste generation \n(materials ending up as waste)’. \nThe framework also contains a number of indicators that provide considerably more information \nthan the one-dimensional Indicator Set’s headline indicators: for example, indicators that \nmeasure intensities (such as energy intensity), trends, and material composition breakdowns. \nThe broader, multi-faceted coverage of the UNECE/OECD indicators o\nﬀers more operationality, \ncontext and nuance to their measurement.  \nHowever, while some of these core and complementary indicators are not directly represented \nby the Indicator Set’s headline indicators, they are necessary to calculate them. For instance, the \nInput Technical Cycling rate requires data on ‘Demand-based raw material consumption (RMC)’, \n‘National recycling rates’ for both municipal solid waste (MSW) and special waste, and ‘Trade in \nwaste, secondary materials, secondary raw materials, second-hand goods’. Similarly, the Input \nEcological Cycling Potential rate requires data on the ‘Proportion of materials from renewable \nnatural stocks in DMC’ as well as ‘Emissions and removals from land use, land-use change, and \nforestry’. \nThis conﬁguration oﬀers an ideal opportunity to superimpose the Circularity Indicator Set’s \nheadline indicators ‘on top of’ the relevant UNECE/OECD indicators, providing a cohesive \nhigher-level set of headline indicators with underlying, complementary UNECE/OECD \nindicators—among others—to support, enrich and expand upon the headline measurements. In \nthis setup, the Circularity Indicator Set’s headline indicators serve as a simpli\nﬁed overview, while \nthe UNECE/OECD indicators provide the detailed data needed to understand trends, variations, \nand broader implications. These form the headline and sub-indicators calculated and explored in \nChapter three of the Circularity Gap Report 2025.  \n \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n1.1 The need for a global circularity benchmark \nThe transition to a circular economy is central to addressing resource depletion, environmental \ndegradation and the general transpassing of planetary boundaries. However, achieving a truly \ncircular economy requires a systematic, data-driven approach that measures and tracks material \nﬂows and stocks, waste generation and treatment rates at diﬀerent scales—global, national, \nsectoral, and product-level. This document lays out the methodology used for the Circularity Gap \nReport (CGR) 2025. It provides a robust framework to measure material circularity, enabling \npolicymakers, researchers, and businesses to assess progress and identify areas for \nimprovement. \n1.2 Purpose and scope of the Circularity Gap Report 2025 \nmethodology \nThe CGR 2025 methodology is designed to: \n● Benchmark material circularity at the global level, with annual updates to track progress \nover time; \n● Provide a standardised Circularity Indicator Set (CIS) that quantiﬁes the scale of material \nand waste ﬂows and the rate of their reintegration into technical and ecological cycles; \n● Ensure methodological alignment with key international frameworks, including the \nConference of European Statisticians (CES) Guidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: \nConceptual Framework, Indicators and Measurement Framework and the ISO/DIS \n59020:2023(E) Circular Economy Standard to allow for comparability and transferability \nfrom the globe to other levels (national or industry or business); \n● Extend beyond traditional recycling metrics by capturing: \n○ The stock dynamics of materials (long-term material accumulations in \ninfrastructure and products); \n○ Trade implications, particularly the movement of secondary materials and waste \nacross borders; \n○ Technical and ecological cycling rates, distinguishing between materials that can \nbe reintroduced into industrial systems and those that follow natural \nbiogeochemical cycles. \n \nThe CGR 2025 calculations draw from over 100 multilateral and national data sources, along with \nexpert estimates and modelling techniques for data gap-ﬁlling, all of which is built into an \nextensive data infrastructure.  \n1.3 Conceptual and statistical foundations \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 3 \n",

      "content": " \nThe CGR Measurement Framework builds upon established industrial ecology and material ﬂow \naccounting principles while expanding their scope to better capture the complexities of modern \nmaterial ﬂows.  \nThe methodology integrates several key concepts. It: \n1. Distinguishes between scale and rate indicators: \n○ Scale indicators measure the absolute magnitude of material ﬂows (for example, \ntotal material extraction, total waste generated). \n○ Rate indicators assess the circular and non-circular performance of an economy, \nand are expressed as percentages of the total amount of materials ﬂowing in and \nout of that economy (for example, the Circularity Metric, which measures the \nshare of secondary material consumption out of total material consumption). \n2. Diﬀerentiates between input-side and output-side circularity: \n○ Input-side indicators measure the share of particular materials streams (e.g., \nsecondary materials, carbon-neutral biomass) in total processed materials. \n○ Output-side indicators assess how much waste is being eﬀectively reintegrated \ninto technical or ecological cycles. \n3. Accounts for technical and ecological cycles: \n○ Technical cycle refers to the processes that products and materials ﬂow through \nin order to maintain their highest possible value at all times. It involves ﬁnite \nmaterials (with the exception of some biomass entering the technical cycle) that \nare not consumed during use and industrial processes such as reuse, \nrefurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling. \n○ Ecological cycle refers to the processes – such as composting and anaerobic \ndigestion – that together help to regenerate natural capital. It involves renewable \nmaterials that can decompose and reintegrate into natural cycles - at least \nwithout harming and preferably regenerating - ecosystems. \n4. Incorporates trade and stock dynamics: \n○ Unlike traditional Economy-Wide Material Flow Accounts (EW-MFA) approaches, \nthe CGR framework explicitly accounts for international trade in secondary \nmaterials and its implications for national circularity. \n○ It also captures material stock accumulation, recognising that materials used for \nlong-lived infrastructure and products delay waste generation and aﬀect \ncircularity rates. \n \nThis methodology document is structured as follows: \n● Section two explores the CIS and deﬁnes the core indicators used to measure \ncircularity, detailing their structure, scope, and alignment with international standards. \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 4 \n",

      "content": " \n2. CIRCULARITY INDICATOR SET \nThe CIS is a system of tiered indicators—scoped out of a multi-thematic conceptual framework \nand grounded in a statistical measurement framework—that allows for a biophysical and \neconomy-wide assessment of a circular economy, including ﬂows-stocks relationships. In its \ncurrent implementation, the scope of the CIS is centred on the material life cycle, the economy’s \nproduction and consumption functions, and partly on their interactions with the environment in \nterms of natural assets and environmental quality implications. \nThe CIS’s headline indicators are based on extended EW-MFA principles taken from the work of \nMayer et al. (2018),3 Haas et al. (2020)4 and other prior research.5, 6, 7 The underlying \nmeasurement framework fully integrates waste ﬂows, recycling, and downcycled materials with \ntraditional EW-MFA statistics. In the CGR model, the approach is further extended to include \nindirect ﬂows, the trade of secondary materials, and other elements (see Section three). The CIS \nis designed for analysis at the macro-level (national, regional), however, it can also be applied at \nthe meso- and micro-level by considering lower-tier indicators (or proxies thereof) that can be \nmore suitable for sector- or product-level analysis. Given the statistical foundations of the \nunderlying CGR Measurement Framework, the CIS calculation relies as much as possible on \nharmonised and regularly updated data, producing comparable results that are suitable for \nbenchmarking across countries and that support consistent monitoring e\nﬀorts.  \nFor its headline indicators, the CIS distinguishes between scale indicators—which provide \nmeasures for the overall size of the socioeconomic metabolism—and rate indicators, which \nmeasure technical and ecological cycling relative to input and output ﬂows. Providing \nindependent measures for ﬂows on both the input and output sides is necessary and insightful \ndue to the delaying eﬀect that in-use stocks of materials have on output ﬂows.

It excludes \noxygen as well as bulk water ﬂows. \n11 Due to data limitations, it is assumed that waste destined for recycling is a good proxy for secondary materials that will \nbe deployed in the economy within the accounting year, according to Eurostat. In reality, there are time lags and \nineﬃciencies in the waste management system: this means that the amount of waste available for recycling and the \nsecondary materials ﬂowing into the economy in the same year are not necessarily the same. \n10 Processed materials include all primary and secondary material consumed within a deﬁned geographical scope. \n9 ‘Technical biomass’ refers to processed materials of biological origin that are diﬃcult to reintroduce into the biosphere \nsafely. These can be biological materials in short-lived applications such as paper, wood packaging, textiles, and bioplastic \nor long-term applications such as timber used for buildings. \n8 Although currently accounting only for materials recovered from recycling (secondary raw materials) and by-products, \nthis category also includes materials in products that have been reused, refurbished, or repaired as well as components \nthat have been remanufactured. \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 7 \n",

      "content": " \nmaterial reserves at the \nnet of their depletions \n \nFor more information on the individual indicators, refer to Methodology for Nations (Section 4.1), \nwith the following notes: \n● Some names and deﬁnitions may diﬀer between the methodology documents for \nNations, Latin America and the Caribbean, and this document. For instance, in this \ndocument the term renewable biomass’ has been replaced with ‘Carbon-Neutral \nBiomass.’ In some cases, this is purely a change in terminology with no di\nﬀerence in \nmeaning. In others, the change in name reﬂects a change in meaning. \n● The methodology documents for Nations and Latin America and the Caribbean \ndistinguish between direct and life-cycle indicators, which are calculated based on either \nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC) or Raw Material Consumption (RMC) \nﬂows. While \nthis distinction is important for regional and national analyses, it is not relevant at the \nglobal level, where there is no diﬀerence between DMC and RMC. For this reason, the \ndistinction is not made in this document. However, it is important to note that the \ndiﬀerentiation between direct (DMC-based) and life-cycle (RMC-based) indicators remains \nrelevant in the broader CGR Measurement Framework and CIS, as the framework is \nstructured at the national level and global ﬁgures are derived from the aggregation of \nnational results. \n● Updates were made to the calculation of the IECPr indicator: \n○ The biomass fraction allocated to Gross Additions to Stocks (GAS) was excluded \nfrom the IECPr. This change prevents double counting between IECPr and NSr, \nand enables more precise monitoring of biomass entering the technical cycle; \n○ Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) emissions were replaced with \nemissions from deforestation in calculations related to the carbon-neutral share \nof biomass in the ECPr and NRBr indicators, on both the input and output sides. \nThis adjustment was made to avoid distorted inclusion of ‘credits,’ particularly \nthose linked to negative LULUCF emissions embodied in traded biomass \nproducts. \nWith the increasing number of frameworks and emerging standards for measuring circularity, \nthe issue of alignment and compatibility becomes relevant. To address this, the CIS was \nevaluated against two of the existing works on measuring circularity, namely: \n● The Conference of European Statisticians Guidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: \nConceptual Framework, Indicators and Measurement Framework prepared jointly by the \nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD); \n● The ISO/DIS 59020:2023(E) Circular economy—Measuring and assessing circularity standard, \nby the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 8 \n",

CGR MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK \nGrounded in the Common Framework of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts \n(SEEA-CF) and its EW-MFA subsystem, the CGR Measurement Framework  builds upon leading \nacademic work in the \nﬁeld of industrial ecology by extending the scope of traditional EW-MFA \nand providing a more comprehensive measure of the scale and circularity of total material and \nwaste ﬂows and their technical and ecological loop closing. For a more detailed description of \nthe diﬀerences between the traditional and extended EW-MFA approach refer to the \nEconomy-Wide Material Flow Accounting section in Annex A of the Methodology for Nations. \nConsistent with the SEEA-CF, the CGR Measurement Framework’s conceptual foundation sees the \nsocioeconomic system as being inside the environment, with ﬂows between and within the two. \nWhile the scope of this analysis is global, the framework is set up at the national level to capture \ntrade implications: that is, \nﬂows between a domestic economy and environment and other \neconomies and the non-domestic environment. This is an important layer to be considered, for \nexample, when calculating footprints and related indicators at the national level. The CGR \nMeasurement Framework introduces several key distinctions that enhance its analytical \ncapabilities: \n● Distinction between rate and scale indicators: Rate indicators at the input side \nmeasure the share of secondary (denoted with light blue in Figure one) and ecologically \ncycled (light green) materials in processed materials (de\nﬁned as primary and secondary \nmaterial inputs), and at the output side the share of technically (light blue) and \necologically (light green) cycled materials in interim outputs (deﬁned as all waste and \nemissions before recovery and recycling or discharge to the environment). The rate \nindicators measure the circularity performance—from 0% in a linear economy with \nneither technical nor ecological cycling—to 100% in a (thermodynamically unfeasible) \nperfect circular economy, where all processed materials are cycled without losses in \nloops;  \n● Distinction between technical and ecological cycling rates: Both rates are derived \nfrom the same underlying system deﬁnition and relate the respective cycled ﬂows to the \nsame reference ﬂow (i.e., to processed materials on the input side and processed \noutputs on the output side). They are, therefore, consistent, additive, mutually exclusive \nand applicable across scales. Technical cycling refers to the ﬂow of re- and down-cyclable \nend-of-life waste (output side) handled by waste management and reintroduced into the \nmarket in the form of secondary materials (input side). It also includes by-products that \nare reused before becoming waste. Ecological cycling refers to the ﬂow of renewable \nbiomass—or in our case carbon-neutral biomass—and the resulting outﬂows to the \nenvironment, which re-enter global biogeochemical cycles. Indicators related to these \nﬂows are shown in light green in Figure one; \n● Distinction between natural and anthropogenic ﬂows: Natural ﬂows are resources \n(such as raw materials extracted on the input side) or residuals (such as emissions and \nwaste discharged on the output side) that originate from or are destined to the \nenvironment. It is important to note the diﬀerence between natural (dark green in Figure \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 12 \n",

On the other \nhand, anthropogenic ﬂows (grey and light blue) are of mixed composition that originate \nfrom or are destined to other socioeconomic systems. While natural ﬂows contain only \nresources, anthropogenic ﬂows can also contain man-made artefacts such as \nmanufactured and semi-manufactured products. This distinction is particularly relevant \nin the context of trade and the calculation of upstream requirements (or raw material \nequivalents) in material footprinting; \n● Distinction between ﬂows and socioeconomic stocks: Activities of the socioeconomic \nsystem are fed by ﬂows of materials from the natural environment, which are then \nprocessed by industries, and are either accumulated in physical stocks (additions to the \nstock of ﬁxed assets) or transformed and released back to the natural environment as \nresiduals. Materials stockpiled in buildings, infrastructure, and durable goods in the \neconomy (long-term materials), as well as old materials that are removed from stock as \nbuildings are demolished and durable goods disposed of (demolition and discard), are \ncaptured by the NAS indicator (dark blue). NAS measures the physical growth of the \neconomy and exposes the time lag between material consumption and waste \ngeneration, which is key to addressing circularity through strategies aimed at extending \nproduct lifetimes such as renovation, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and \nsharing. In our framework, these strategies would result in an increase of the service \nlifetime of in-use stocks and potentially a stabilisation of in-use stock growth, as indicated \nby NAS. Thus, even though we don’t have data on the prevalence of these strategies, \ntheir eﬀects can be observed through this indicator, especially in combination with \nsupporting lower-tier indicators. \nFigure one shows the structure of the CGR Measurement Framework and its link with the CIS \nheadline indicators. The colour coding highlights the relationship between some variables of the \nframework, the CIS indicators and the key distinctions mentioned above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 13 \n",

Waste may be generated at diﬀerent stages of the \nsupply chain, from extraction to ﬁnal use, and from both short-lived material uses (most of \nmunicipal solid waste, packaging waste or sludges and ashes from combustion) and long-lived \nmaterial uses (construction and demolition waste or discarded vehicles, for example).  \nIn the traditional EW-MFA approach, waste is only accounted for to the extent to which it is \nreleased back to the environment through open dumping, while landﬁlls are considered as a \nform of stock addition. Recycled material ﬂows are considered ﬂows within the economy (for \nexample, of metals, paper and glass) and thus are not considered as outputs (nor inputs).  \nConversely, in the extended EW-MFA approach, recycled materials (as well as other ‘internal \nﬂows’ such as by-products and reused products) are included while landﬁlls are considered to be \npart of the environment and not a form of stock addition, and are thus included as part of \nprocessed output.  \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 25 \n",

      "content": " \nWaste generated from the treatment of waste, also referred to as secondary waste, is not \naccounted for in the context of this framework as it would translate into double counting. \nWaste from unused extraction (such as excavated earth, overburden, dredging spoils, etcetera) \nand used extraction (such as extractive ore waste, tailings, etcetera) could not be di\nﬀerentiated \ndue to data limitations. In the application of this methodological framework at the national level, \ninput-and output-side statistics are harmonised, as described Methodology for Nations. This \nharmonisation is not possible at the global level.  \nRecycled ﬂows, hereafter referred to as secondary materials (SM), refer to materials recovered \nthrough all forms of recycling including downcycling (for example, backﬁlling). Reused products \nand materials including industrial by-products are also considered secondary materials. In this \ndocument, the term ‘recycled ﬂow’ and ‘secondary materials’ are used interchangeably, as a \nstudy carried out by Eurostat48 concluded that the input to recovery plants is an acceptable proxy \nfor the output from recovery plants. However, it should be noted that there are time lags and \nineﬃciencies in the waste management system: this means that the amount of waste available \nfor recycling and the secondary materials ﬂowing into the economy in the same year are not \nnecessarily the same. The measurement framework was built upon a systems and material \nperspective of the economy, and based the assessment as far as possible on statistical data from \nnational (i.e. statistical oﬃces) and international (i.e. FAOSTAT, IRP) oﬃcial environmental \nreporting systems. While recovered materials were either reported in waste statistics or could be \ndirectly quantiﬁed, this was not possible for other circular strategies such as the extension of \nproduct lifetimes, reuse and remanufacturing, or sharing. \nTracing the transformation of materials from their extraction until their end-of-life requires the \nintegration of EW-MFA and waste statistics. The latter, however, are lacking in many countries \nand need to be estimated based on available data. One of the most comprehensive databases \non waste management is the What-a-Waste (WaW) v2.0 database by the World Bank. This was \nused as the starting point for the estimation of waste generation, collection and treatment for all \ncountries in the world. While the main advantage of this database is the wide coverage across \ncountries and indicators, the completeness and time coverage of the data points can vary greatly \nand requires extensive data-gap-\nﬁlling and extrapolation. \nOur step-by-step approach for data manipulation, including interpolation, back- and now-casting \nis the following:49 \n● Step one—Primary data collection for bottom-up corrections: This entailed desk \nresearch focused on the largest countries by waste generation (excluding EU countries, \nsee ‘Data sources’ sections).

The data collected covered municipal solid waste (MSW) \nand special waste (SW) generation, collection rates and treatment rates at the highest \nlevel of detail and for the most recent year available; \n● Step two—MSW generation nowcasting: This analysis assumes that MSW generation \ngrows primarily based on population and aﬄuence. Following the approach used by Kaza \net al. (2018),51 a regression formula based on GDP per capita was used to estimate the \ndevelopment of MSW generation per capita for each country between the source and \ntarget years. Population ﬁgures from the UN’s World Population Prospects52 were then \nused to estimate total MSW generation for the target year. If MSW data were available for \nthe target year, the original data was used; \n● Step three—SW and collection rates data interpolation: Because a lot of the regions \nhave missing data for at least one of the SW subtotals, interpolation was required. While \nthe earlier approach would interpolate within income groups, such a hard cut-oﬀ was not \nalways desirable while also reducing the bin size for low-income regions to a very small \nset of candidates. In the improved interpolation approach, spatial distance and \ndiﬀerence (distance) in GDP per capita were used instead. For EU countries, data gaps in \nEurostat’s time series were ﬁlled using basic linear interpolation. For edge data, the ﬁrst \nor last known value was used instead. Agricultural waste, entirely made of biomass, is \nconsidered as part of the ecological cycle as it is mainly returned back to the \nenvironment through soil application or burnt in open ﬁres (emissions from biomass \ncombustion). Because biomass ﬂows on both the input and output side are accounted \nfor by the ECPr indicators rather then TCr ones, agricultural waste was excluded from the \nSW dataset to avoid double counting; \n● Step four—SW generation nowcasting: This analysis assumes that SW generation \ngrows primarily based on sectoral gross output. Construction and manufacturing \nindustry output from the Eora database were matched to the corresponding physical \nwaste stream, in this case construction and demolition waste (C&DW) and industrial \nwaste, to calculate SW generation intensities for the source years (various) and multiplied \nby the historical gross sectoral output for the target year. If waste data was missing, the \nintensity factor is interpolated using the spatial/income interpolation method described \nabove; \n● Step ﬁve—Treatment rates nowcasting: For each country, treatment rates for a source \nyear were gathered. Time series of gross output for waste treatment sectors were \n52 UN World Population Prospect 2019 extracted from File POP/1-1: Total population (both sexes combined) by region, \nsubregion and country, annually for 1950–2100 (unit: thousands of people). \n51 Kaza, Silpa; Yao, Lisa C.; Bhada-Tata, Perinaz; Van Woerden, Frank. 2018.

Matching tables of WaW treatment types and countries to \nExiobase waste treatment sectors and regions were developed, and the monetary-based \nscaling factors were used to scale the mass-based waste treatment rates. For instance, if \nthe aggregated gross output of all re-processing sectors of a country in Exiobase \nincreased by 10% between the source and target year (i.e. a scaling factor of 1.1), then \nthe recycling rate also increased by 10%. After applying the nowcasting factor, the waste \ntreatment rates were renormalised to sum to 100%. Waste treatment types that do not \nhave a relevant waste sector proxy were ignored (for example,uncontrolled waste \ndisposal). Note that this approach assumes full linearity between the monetary gross \noutput of a waste treatment sector and the physical volume treated by the same. This \nassumption was not empirically tested. Furthermore, for many non-OECD countries with \nlacking data, treatment rates for MSW were applied to SW fractions under the \nassumptions that the two types of waste were treated alike. Finally, within the context of \nthis framework, rates for anaerobic digestion and composting were not included since \norganic waste \nﬂows (such as agricultural waste, food waste, etcetera) are accounted for \nby the input and output ECPr rather than the input and output TCr; \n● Step six—Top-down consolidation: Results from the CGR Engine were benchmarked \nagainst those from the MISO v.1 model. Datasets from two publications using the same \ninput data are used: A time series (1900-2015) of DE, Material use, NAS and DPO by \nKraussman et al. (2018)54 and projections of stock-related variables, i.e. primary and \nsecondary stock-building materials, end-of-life waste from stocks and ﬁnal waste after \nrecycling by Wiedenhofer et al. (2019).55 The two datasets are combined to get a \nconsistent time series for key variables up to 2021 and the ratio of demolition and \ndiscard (calculated as GAS - NAS) to the DMC of non-metallic minerals estimated. This \nratio is a proxy for the average relationship between the in\nﬂow of stock-building \nconstruction materials and the amount of C&DW generated and it is used as a model \nconstraint for the calibration of C&DW estimates (including that which is destined to \nrecycling). For each country and year, the ratio between the DMC of non-metallic \nminerals and C&DW has to be equal or higher than the global average. This constraint is \nnot applied to the countries with bottom-up corrections for the amount of C&DW. \n \nThe generalised formula for the calculation of waste treated volumes is the following: \n55 Wiedenhofer, D., Fishman, T., Lauk, C., Haas, W., & Krausmann, F.

The database mainly focuses on MSW, which includes \nresidential, commercial and institutional waste. SW, which encompasses industrial, medical, \nhazardous, electronic, and C&DW is also compiled to the extent possible. Actual values rather \nthan estimates or projections are prioritised, even if it requires the use of older data.

Furthermore, when a year \nrange is reported in the original source, the \nﬁnal year of the range is provided in this document’s \ndata set. Overall, this translates into highly fragmented and heterogeneous data points from a \ntemporal perspective. Waste collection coverage data are reported according to multiple \ndeﬁnitions: amount of waste collected, number of households served, population served or \ngeographic area covered. Waste treatment and disposal includes recycling, composting, \nanaerobic digestion, incineration, landﬁlling, open dumping and dumping in marine areas or \nwaterways. Given the variability of types of landﬁlls used, data were collected for three types of \nlandﬁlls: sanitary landﬁlls with landﬁll gas collection systems, controlled landﬁlls that are \nengineered but for which landﬁll gas collection systems do not exist or are unknown, and \nuncategorised landﬁlls. In cases where disposal and treatment percentages did not add up to \n100% or where a portion of waste is uncollected, the remaining amount was categorised as \nwaste ‘unaccounted for.’ Waste not accounted for by formal disposal methods, such as landﬁlls \nor recycling, was assumed to be dumped. Waste that is disposed of in waterways and that is \nmanaged in low- and middle-income countries in ‘other’ manners was also assumed to be \ndumped. Reported collection and treatment rates refer to MSW only. \nThe OECD data explorer56 57 was used as the main source for up-to-date MSW and hazardous \nwaste data. Eurostat was used to update EU countries with great accuracy. For SW, waste \ngeneration data was sourced from env_was_gen.58 Waste treatment rates were calculated from \nthe env_was_trt dataset which grants more control than the env_wasoper dataset over waste \nstream to be included.

The main limitations and avenues for future improvement are listed \nbelow: \n● The choice of gross output—and more generally, monetary data—to extrapolate SW has \nmany shortcomings: for example, the exclusion of waste generation by the informal \neconomy and the overestimation of waste generation for geographically small countries \nwith high GDP. C&DW could be better estimated using a dynamic stock and \nﬂow model; \n● For EU countries, the application of a standard approach to the calculation of volumes of \ntreated waste treatment rates (i.e. multiplication of waste generation with treatment \nrates) results in discrepancies in overall volumes of waste treated between the engine \nand env_wastrt. Moreover, for EU countries treatment rates are calculated ‘at the \ntreatment facility gates’, thus including imported and excluded exported waste, while \nwaste generated is just that produced within territorial borders (excluding imported and \nincluding exported waste). For non EU countries, this information is not available and \nthus this eﬀect remains unknown;  \n● The application of the same collection and treatment rates for MSW and SW could be \nimproved by the use of speciﬁc rates for each type for all countries; \n● The use of waste treatment sectors’ gross monetary output for the development of \nscaling factors could be improved by the selection of a more speci\nﬁc factor such as \ninvestment in waste treatment technologies. \nWhile recovered materials were either reported in waste statistics or could be directly quantiﬁed, \nthis was not possible for other circular strategies such as the extension of product lifetimes, \nrefurbishment, remanufacturing, or sharing. As already mentioned in the CGR Measurement \nFramework, these strategies would result in an increase of the service lifetime of in-use stocks \nand potentially a stabilisation of in-use stock growth, as indicated by the NAS. Thus, even though \nthese strategies are di\nﬃcult to measure directly, their eﬀects on the size of inﬂows, additions to \nstock, and outﬂows can be substantial and are observable via the CGR Measurement Framework . \n80 Set as a weighted average between the C&D recycling rate from: US EPA.

When adjusting the amounts of recycled waste in treatment operations by \nimports and exports of secondary materials, the country that uses the secondary material gets \nthe 'credit' for contributing to the worldwide saving of primary raw materials. This perspective is \ncloser to the national accounts' logic in which most re-attributions are directed towards ﬁnal use.  \nFor more extensive information on trade in secondary materials and how this inﬂuences the \nITCr, refer to Box three in Methodology for Nations. \n4.3.2.2 Data sources \nTo calculate the amounts of imported and exported waste and by-products, Eurostat has \nidentiﬁed a list of Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes that can be considered as such.81 82 For \napplication to non-EU countries, Circle Economy has developed a mapping table between the CN \nand Harmonised System (HS) classiﬁcation that replicates this methodology on international \nbilateral trade databases such as BACI.83 \n4.3.2.3 Gaps and limitations \nDue to the lack of available statistics, domestic use and trade of reused goods as well as other \ntypes of ‘inner ﬂows’ such on-site recycling is currently poorly or not at all captured in the \nanalysis. Furthermore, while trade in by-products can be estimated from international trade \ndatabases, the production for domestic use of by-products is missing. At the country-level this \ncan result in an overly negative consumption of by-products due to the lack of the ‘domestic’ \ncomponent and, in some cases, overall negative consumption of secondary materials. \n4.3.3 Module 3.3: Dissipative uses and losses \n4.3.3.1 Description \nSome materials—such as manure, fertilisers or sewage sludge—are deliberately dissipated into \nthe environment because dispersal is an inherent quality of product use or quality and cannot be \navoided.84 The explicit accounting of these ﬂows is only relevant in the context of the traditional \napproach while in the extended one they are estimated as a residual item within processed \n84 Matthews, E., Amann, C., Bringezu, S., Fischer-Kowalski, M., Hüttler, W., Kleijn, R., ... & Weisz, H.

These improvements will enhance the comprehensiveness, \naccuracy, and applicability of the methodology, ensuring that it remains a reliable tool for \nassessing global circularity. The key areas of improvement can be grouped into three categories: \nthe implementation of the conceptual framework, the measurement framework, and the CIS. \n5.1 Enhance the conceptual framework \nImplementing the conceptual framework in line with the CES Guidelines: The current CIS \nscope primarily focuses on the material dimension of the circular economy, speciﬁcally the \naspect of ‘Material life cycles and value chains’. To fully implement the conceptual framework in \nline with the CES Guidelines for Measuring Circular Economy, Part A: Conceptual Framework, \nIndicators and Measurement Framework, additional dimensions will need to be integrated—such \nas environmental impacts, employment, and ﬁnancial aspects. The expansion will follow a similar \napproach to that used for the ‘Material life cycles and value chains’ aspect: \n● Step 1: Evaluate the indicators proposed in the CES Guidelines for other circular economy \naspects—‘Interactions with the environment’, ‘Responses and actions’, and \n‘Socioeconomic opportunities’. This assessment will consider criteria such as relevance \nand measurability to select the most appropriate indicators for inclusion in the CIS. \nIndicators identiﬁed as ‘core’ in the Guidelines will be treated as highly relevant by \ndefault. \n● Step 2: Identify alternative indicators for areas marked in the CES Guidelines as \n‘placeholders’ or where the most relevant indicators are yet to be de\nﬁned. This includes \nincorporating as complementary or substitute indicators, including metrics, such as: \n○ The number of direct and indirect circular jobs, measured using the Circular Job \nAnalysis approach developed by Circle Economy and UNEP, with an update \ncurrently in development with ILO-WB;87 \n○ The amount of investments in circular activities or businesses, as guided by the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC)—which assessed the landscape of \nsustainable \nﬁnance and streamlined various existing frameworks into a simpliﬁed \nguideline for classifying circular investments88—and ﬁrst measured by Circle \nEconomy in the Circularity Gap Report Finance.89 \n89 Circle Economy.

Where no suitable source or method exists, the indicator will be \nretained as a reference, and a placeholder will be proposed. This process will be iterative, \nleading to the development of: \n○ A long-list of ideal indicators, and \n○ A short-list of suitable indicators for implementation. \n● Step 4 (Optional): As with the ‘Material life cycles and value chains’ aspect, develop \nheadline indicators for the new dimensions. This may involve techniques such as \nnormalisation or weighting to enable comparability and integration across aspects. \nStrengthening Tier two and Tier three Indicators: Due to existing data limitations, certain \ncomplementary (Tier two) and contextual (Tier three) indicators are absent or temporarily \nreplaced with proxies in the CGR 2025. Developing a more systematic approach for integrating \nlower-tier indicators will improve the framework’s analytical depth and applicability. \n5.2 Reﬁning the measurement framework \nImplementing country-level extended MFA: A critical improvement is the full application of \nthe extended MFA approach at the country level. This requires higher-resolution data to \ndi\nﬀerentiate waste streams by origin (material versus energy use) and composition. Additionally, \nimproving the tracking of energy carriers (for example, moving from energy balances to Physical \nEnergy Flow Accounts) and reconciling traditional and extended MFA results through \noptimisation algorithms will enhance accuracy. \nAdvancing Module three: Waste: Given the complexity and data scarcity in waste tracking, the \nwaste module remains a priority for improvement. The following aspects require attention: \n● Quantifying waste from unused domestic extraction: This is essential for harmonising \ninput- and output-side statistical data collection; \n● Improving coverage of waste generation and treatment data: Many data-scarce countries \ncurrently assume that MSW treatment rates apply to all solid waste streams, leading to \ninaccuracies. Developing bottom-up corrections or systematic estimations will enhance \nprecision; \n● Addressing inconsistencies in waste treatment rate calculations: Existing datasets often \nrecord waste treatment rates under di\nﬀerent principles, leading to potential \noverestimations (such as in EU countries) or underestimations elsewhere. A structured \nevaluation and correction process is necessary. \nReducing dependence on model constraints: Gradual reﬁnement of the framework, including \nthe adoption of the MISO v2 model, will eventually eliminate the need for top-down constraints \nthat align results with global models. \nCircularity Gap Report 2025 Methodology Document | 38 \n",

This simpliﬁcation ignores sorting and processing losses and does not diﬀerentiate \nbetween diﬀerent end-of-life waste age cohorts. Increasing the level of detail in the waste \nmanagement process will signiﬁcantly improve stock-ﬂow dynamics representation. \nDeveloping criteria for sustainable biomass management: Establishing clear input- and \noutput-side criteria for deﬁning sustainably managed and regenerative biomass will enhance \nmeasurement accuracy. This will involve identifying relevant datasets (such as certiﬁcation \nschemes) or methodologies (such as Substance Flow Analysis) that support the assessment of \nsustainability in biomass use. \nResolving the ‘net extraction abroad (NEA) issue’ in national circularity assessments: \nCountry-level circularity results can be calculated using either DMC or RMC. While RMC better \nreﬂects a country's material extraction pressure, its application to the CIS is complex due to \nunresolved methodological challenges (see section ‘NEA issue’ in Appendix A of Methodology for \nNations).

The report analyzes various sub-indicators to provide a detailed picture of global circularity and identify areas needing targeted action. Key findings reveal that despite some progress, negative trends are offsetting improvements. For instance, secondary material use has increased, but the Circularity Metric continues to fall due to rapid growth in material extraction.  The scale of virgin, non-renewable materials disposed of without recovery has also risen, highlighting untapped potential for increasing circularity.  The absolute scale of biomass extraction, fossil fuel use, and net additions to stocks have all increased despite relatively stable rates.
