OCR the file into Markdown, inheriting Markdown structure.
Tables should be formatted as HTML.

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on main content. EXCLUDE the following sections:
- Author lists and affiliations
- References and bibliography
- Acknowledgements
- Table of contents
- Abstract (unless it contains unique key information)
- Appendices with raw data
- Copyright and publication information

Chunk the document into sections of roughly 250-1000 words by identifying parts with the same semantic theme. Focus on:
- Main body text with key findings
- Important conclusions and insights
- Methodology explanations
- Data analysis and results
- Executive summaries with substantive content

These chunks will be used in a RAG pipeline to answer user questions.
Surround the chunks with <chunk></chunk> tags.
